The game features a detailed skill-based character system, multiple skill-based ways to handle quests, choices &amp; consequences, and extensive dialogue trees.","The Age of Decadence, our first but hopefully not the last RPG, is now available. If you've been following it or playing it in Early Access, you know what to expect. If you've just discovered it, &quot;stay awhile and listen&quot;. The most commonly asked question is:<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>What Kind of Game Is It?</strong></h2><br>It’s a very different game than anything you’ve ever played. I’m sure you’ve noticed that the RPG genre hasn’t really been explored yet and most RPGs follow the formula that didn’t change in 20 years. While there were always games that strayed off the beaten path – Darklands, Planescape: Torment, King of Dragon Pass – such games were the exceptions that only reinforced the rule. <br><br>The Age of Decadence is an experiment, an attempt to explore a different direction, taking you back to the PnP roots of the genre. It doesn’t mean that the game is awesome. In fact, there is a good chance that you won’t like it, precisely because we took too many liberties with the established design. <br><br>So What Sets The Age of Decadence Apart From Other Games?<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>1. The Setup</strong></h2><br>Traditionally, many fantasy RPGs are about killing things, clearing up dungeons, and being a hero. There is nothing wrong with mindless fun and wish fulfillment, but we want to offer you something different. To quote Tom Chick (Quarter to Three's game critic):<br><br>&quot;But Age of Decadence wants nothing to do with kobolds, just as it wants nothing to do with Doo-dads of Unimaginable Power. The overarching idea is a crumbling society divided among three noble Houses, each fumbling around in its own version of darkness to comprehend what destroyed the world. That’s the central mystery. It plays out like noir in that you are the detective, piecing together what really happened from differing accounts, all vividly written with clear voices and efficient prose. And like a detective in a noir yarn, you can’t help but become part of the central mystery, effecting an outcome you might not have intended.&quot;<br><br>The Age of Decadence is not a game about killing monsters or exploring mystical lands, but rather, surviving amid the greed and brutality of your fellow humans and carving out a name for yourself. Good and bad are purely relative. It’s a world of scheming and backstabbing in which your words and actions have the potential to forge alliances and sow discord, and your path is never certain.<br><br>You get to play with seven different factions: three Noble Houses and four 'professional' guilds: merchants, assassins, thieves, and the army, all fighting for power or influence; over 100 named characters, over 750 ‘generic’ characters with unique IDs taking part in violent take-overs, assassinations, and power grabs, and over 600,000 words of dialogue: a well-developed and thought through world, believable characters, realistic motivations, but no elves, dwarves, magic, and wizards in fashionable, pointy hats.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>2. Combat difficulty</strong></h2><br>Another design aspect worth mentioning is combat difficulty. It’s a hard game. <br><br>Combat difficulty is integrated into the setting. You can’t say that the world is harsh and unforgiving and then let the player kill everyone who looks at him or her funny. The game has to be hard, dying should be easy, and you should have reasons to pick your fights.<br><br>You aren’t a powerful hero who can defeat anyone and save the world and it is the difficulty that reinforces this notion. Make the game easier and we’re back to the powerful hero setup. So unless you’re a natural born killer, watch what you say and think before you act or you’ll end up dead before you can blink.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>3. Choices &amp; Consequences</strong></h2><br>Choices are what the game is all about - crafting your own narrative via a variety of choices that alter the story, playing field, and your options down the road. From multiple quest solutions to branching questlines you'll have plenty decisions to make and consequences of said decisions to deal with, which is what makes the game incredibly replayable.<br><br>Starting the game as a mercenary and joining the Imperial Guards will give a completely different experience, different quests, different content and points of view than, say, playing the game as a merchant (less buying low and selling high, more scheming and plotting to gain advantages for the guild), a praetor serving a Noble House, or an assassin.<br><br>The questlines are interwoven, forming a large, overarching story, so playing the game only once will be like witnessing events from a single perspective, which is limited by default. You will have to play the game several times to better understand what’s going on, piece everything together, and see the full effect of the choices you make.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>The Big Question: Should You Buy The Game?</strong></h2><br>Try before you buy. Even if everything I said sounds exactly like your kind of game, try the demo first. That’s what it’s there for. It gives you access to the first Chapter, consisting of 3 locations and about 30 quests split between mutually exclusive questlines and decisions."

Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Story</h2>The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike.<br><br><br>Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well.<br><br>But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten...<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective<br></li><li>Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H.

<br />
American scientists working for Department of Defense find out that this mineral is in fact identical to the substance used to power an extraterrestrial artifact in their possession. This object is called the EON (Extraterrestrial Object Nexus).<br />
<br />
It was found in 1919 by Colonel Emerson near the site of the Tunguska explosion. Emerson was the commander of a US military unit in charge of transporting US war supplies from the city of Vladivostok to the Eastern front during World War I.<br />
<br />
DoD Experiments have shown that items placed in the capsule are transported hundreds of thousands of years back in time. The American scientists were not able to understand its construction, nor could they manage to synthesize its fuel.

The wars, famines and suffering of the last 20 millennia were to become a distant, fading memory, as scientific advances brought global peace and prosperity. Toward the end of the 20th century, a now forgotten US president even went so far as to officially proclaim the arrival of a New World Order, in which right, not might, would govern international relations. This bright future was not to be. First came a meltdown of the international stock and currency exchanges. Then the major international conglomerates were dissolved in a vain attempt to stop the fiscal hemorrhage. By 2012 the world economy had collapsed. Poverty and hunger caused social and political tensions to flare. As the crisis wore on, few were bold or naive enough to predict anything positive for the future. Most realized that the planet was on the verge of global conflict.<br><br>In 2048, the anticipated global conflict broke out with a violence that shook the planet to its core. All major centralized governments were destroyed in the maelstrom. Europe and Eastern Asia bore the brunt of the devastation, as entire urban centres, from Madrid to Moscow and from Seoul to Singapore were literally wiped off the map. <br>The human race has always been known for its resiliency. Within a dozen years, the Earth's inhabitants had begun to restore their old nationalities - with a few twists. Twelve states of the former United States joined together to form a new country, called the United Civilized States. The UCS citizens had essentially given up their old roles as producers and leaders. Nearly all work was being performed by robots which are controlled by expert computer systems. Not surprisingly, the human inhabitants of the UCS had become lazy and decadent.<br><br>The 20th-century dream for a better world had ended in death and destruction.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>EARTH 2150: THE MOON PROJECT</strong></h2>The year 2150 … one of the blackest chapters in the history of mankind.

<br />
We wanted to make something that we ourselves would like to play - a game chock-full of what’s cool about spaceships shooting each other up and with none of that boring stuff.<br />
We set out to make a game with both a light-hearted gameplay that is hard to find today and deep tactical potential that allows for sophisticated approach to team play.<br />
So we made Cannons Lasers Rockets - a fast-paced, bright and colorful space arcade equally enjoyable for hardcore and casual gamers.<br />
<br />
In our game you will discover that: <br />
<br />
SPACE COMBAT IS EASY <br />
A videogame spaceship is usually not an easy ride - three-dimensional navigation makes you dizzy and disoriented. But in CLR you struggle against your opponents, not against your controls. We simplified gameplay just enough so you wouldn’t need to BE a great star pilot to FEEL like one.<br />
<br />
SPACE COMBAT IS INTERESTING <br />
No boring parts, only what you come for - going into combat to send some rockets into the other guy’s hull.<br />
And if you eventually get a little tired of shooting, and start looking for more - be sure that we will give you more. Multiple game modes, a metric ton of different tactical situations, a MOBA core that creates many possibilities for fun and meaningful gameplay - and even more!<br />
<br />
SPACE COMBAT IS FUN <br />
We don’t really know what «realistic» starships will look like, so we don’t really care. A ship in a game should be fun to look at and fun to ride in, period. We want ships to be weird, plentiful and different - everyone will find one that is suited just for them, both in visual style and the distinct way of playing that comes with every ship. <br />
We streamlined our gameplay as much as we could, and then we turned the coolness knob up to eleven!"

The game’s difficulty is accomplished only by nine distinctive AI personalities, each with their own advantages and special skills. AI Commanders are able to evaluate and gain tactical superiority in real time, reacting according to their different commanding skills, aggressively or defensively, heroically or cunningly and resemble different, competent human players. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Each one of the AI generals is a formidable, non-scripted opponent who can actively try to flank you, secure strategic locations with artillery, keep reserves and reinforce areas that it attacks or defends. The AI will try to win the battle with tactics that fit to its personality. For example a defensive opponent may not attack ferociously in the first engagement and progressively advance its forces in the next battles.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u><i>What players say</i></u><i>: “Fantastic AI - don't know what kind of brain you put in this game but it works”</i></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><strong>Multi-Day Dynamic Battle</strong> </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">On the morning of July 1st 1863, the two armies meet near Gettysburg.

What if Lee attacked the center of the Union Army early in the morning of July 2nd of 1863 instead of attempting to flank the extreme left in the afternoon? What would happen if Meade counter-attacked on July 4th 1863? These questions and more can be answered within the game engine of Ultimate General: Gettysburg.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">The battle is dynamically fought in time phases and can last up to 4 days. Each day can be separated by up to 3 time phases and the armies’ condition and positioning on the map are saved.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">According to battle events, you have the possibility to take decisions that can change the tide of the battle based on your prior tactical prowess. For example, when leading the Confederates, on the morning of July 2nd, you can choose to attack at Cemetery Hill and not make a delayed flanking maneuver at Peach Orchard… if you have managed to take Seminary Ridge the previous day! You can even choose to defend and wait for your AI opponent to take the initiative between days.

Units do not need your micromanagement because they are able to act on their own initiative and re-align, switch targets, withdraw and form battle lines without player input. Consequently, you are able to give generic commands to your units and can rely on them to fight efficiently without the need for “babysitting”. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u><i>What players say</i></u><i>: “Innovative movement system - this is by far an awesome system they developed. It’s not only insanely easy to learn, but also incredibly innovative”</i></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><strong>Detailed Map of Gettysburg</strong> </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Utilizing satellite images and historical maps, every major location, house, ridge and hill are depicted as accurately as possible within the game’s unique art style. If you are an American Civil War enthusiast, you will be especially happy to notice the amount of precision and information that the map provides. Not only will you be able to better understand the historical layout of the map, you will also be able to make use of each location and landmark in battle, thanks to the simulation of cover, concealment, terrain and high ground in the game. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u><i>What players say</i></u><i>: “Incredible Gorgeous Map - I had to capitalize that because this map is by far one of the best maps of Gettysburg I have ever seen either in a game or even in books”</i></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><strong>Advanced Line of Sight</strong></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Elevation and obstructions affect unit visibility realistically. Units may make use of concealment and cover to survive artillery barrages, stage ambushes and more, but beware – the AI will attempt to do the same to you. The units enter or exit the Fog of War gradually with a fade in/out effect that helps you perceive their hiding and course seamlessly. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u><i>What players say</i></u><i>: “The way Game Labs implemented Line of Sight in this game should be held as an example to other developers to do the same”</i></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><strong>Numerous Tactical Factors</strong> </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">In Ultimate General: Gettysburg, you will realize that army units are not “machines” that blindly follow orders, but they need to conserve strength and courage for decisive battle actions. Every basic tactical element that is expected for a strategy game is incorporated into gameplay. Most importantly, morale is affected by many factors including flank or rear attacks, casualties, volley shocks, artillery fire and fatigue. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u><i>What players say</i></u><i>: “... positioning of units matters. You really bring the struggles of 19th century warfare to life here”</i></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><strong>Historically Accurate Forces and Leaders</strong> </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Ultimate General: Gettysburg includes the full order of battle for the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Unit sizes range from the small artillery batteries to vast infantry brigades with cavalry and skirmishers in between.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">All brigades have troop numbers and differing competencies based on historical facts. Additionally, all artillery battery numbers and types are correctly simulated. Lastly, major generals and officers actively participate in the battlefield to organize and support the armies and appear in after action battle reports to help you monitor battle progress. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u><i>What players say</i></u><i>: “Immersive American Civil War feel: sounds, portraits and general historical authentic really make this one of the most immersive historical games I have played, and I am a total history buff”</i></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Furthermore, every inch of the map has a strategic role. Sloping, terrain type and obstructions affect unit movement realistically. Elevations, ridges and hills provide excellent firing positions and give increased sight, morale and accuracy to troops stationed there.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">By placing your units close to each other, they become more resilient to charges and flank attacks but get more vulnerable to projectile fire. Thus, forcing your enemy to keep his lines dense while you shell him with artillery can be a valid tactic. As the condition of your units changes dynamically during the battle, the effectiveness of your whole army is affected. For example, units fire more coordinated volleys when they have high morale and have more discipline and tight formations.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">These and many more deep gameplay mechanics are packed into a simple and intuitive GUI that aims to ease the game experience for the player without overwhelming with complex statistics.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""> </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph""><strong>Ultimate General: Gettysburg</strong> is developed by Game Labs and designed by Nick Thomadis, known for his successful and popular “DarthMod” series.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">How to Play</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph""> Please read our guide</p>"

It is an excellent tool for anyone who wants to create realistic character avatars in no time. You can simply choose what items to display on your character, save as an image on a preset or transparent background, and use it for anything you would like to. You don't have to worry about lighting or finding the right camera angles, as everything has been prerendered and post-worked for you, so creating characters is really just a matter of clicking some buttons!

The software is mainly used by role-players to illustrate their player and non-player characters, but don't have the resources to create or buy many unique characters that fit their needs. The option to save the images as tokens and cards simultaneously even reduces the work needed to use the pictures in a session moments after they've been created. The characters can be saved and loaded using our custom file format, which enables an easy way to manage character progression, as changing little details are quick and convenient.<br />

Pure action – pure excitement!","<strong>RoBoRumble</strong> is a real-time 3D strategy game, offering two major battle campaigns consisting of 15 missions each and a multi-player mode with hot combat for up to four players at a time. One of <strong>RoBoRumble</strong>'s key features is the unique way in which Units are assembled. Unlike most games of this type, where the player is given a palette of already designed Units to choose from, in <strong>RoBoRumble</strong> the player constructs his own from a palette of different components. This gives a far greater number of variations and adds an extra strategic dimension to the game. <br><br>Each Unit (known as a &quot;Robo&quot;) consists of a chassis and a weapon mounted on it. Available chassis designs range from two- or four-legged runners to jet-propelled, tracked or wheel-based craft and even tele-porters. There's also no shortage of weapons to mount on them. In addition to the standard lasers, heavy artillery and machine guns, <strong>RoBoRumble</strong> offers some imaginative creations like an &quot;Oiler&quot;, that slows the enemy down by leaving slippery pools in his path, and the &quot;Whirlwind&quot;, that picks up the enemy and throws him against the nearest wall.  Each of the two parties in the conflict have eight different chassis and weapons to choose from.  One side leans more toward &quot;brawn&quot;, utilizing pure firepower, while the other tries the &quot;brains&quot; method of better weapons design. Whichever side the player chooses, only a small pool of weapons is available at the beginning. The player can increase the pool by giving out development contracts between missions.<br><br>The third optional component of a Robo is the so-called &quot;Booster&quot;. This normally costs only a fraction of the other two components, but can have a huge effect on the game. Some Boosters double the Robo's speed, while others give the Robo more firepower or firing range, make him invisible, or increase his intelligence. <br><br>The relatively complex way of creating Robos stands in heavy contrast to the intentionally simple resource management. The source and at the same time, the main base, of the player's and the enemy's army is a dome-shaped, glowing &quot;Energy Pool&quot;, which he must protect from attacks. The pool's capacity, which varies with each mission, is given to the player as a &quot;budget&quot; and used to create Robos. When a Robo is destroyed, his &quot;energy&quot; (the energy which was invested in creating him), flows back into the pool, so the player can build new units.<br><br>The base consists of three different energy levels. Whenever one of these levels comes under sustained fire and is destroyed, it triggers a violent explosion that, in turn, destroys all enemies in the immediate area. This &quot;cleansing&quot; effect sees to it that the defending party gains time to gather his troops and go on the counterattack.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>STORY</strong></h2>The distant future – the planet Mars.

They actually have individual destinations: people want to check out attractions, go shopping, or visit friends. Products also have their destinations - factories have contracts with each other and they won't sell or buy from anyone else. If you don't give them the possibility to go where they want, they simply won't use your transport company.<br></li><li><strong>Complete the Chain</strong><br>Transporting products not only gives you money, but makes the economy roll.

Every unit of anything you transport will affect the nearby cities making them grow and prosper. Sometimes cities will create new attractions and places of interest, which attract a lot more passengers. Or maybe your service may attract new industries, that give you even more opportunities.

We'd rather have a happy non-customer than an unhappy customer. This is what STRAFE® isn't:<br> <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not a traditional shooter or a &quot;Quake Clone&quot; </strong> - STRAFE®  pays homage to many classic shooters, and it features many of the classic elements of old school shooters but STRAFE® is a roguelike. This means that it was designed from the ground up for replayability and randomization. Every room in STRAFE® was designed by hand and is seamlessly connected by our level generator to create unique experiences.<br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® does not have lives or checkpoints</strong> - As a roguelike, if you die in STRAFE® you will start at the beginning of the game and everything will randomize. The game is balanced around this idea to avoid frustration. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not a multiplayer game</strong> - There is no multiplayer deathmatch or co-op in STRAFE®. But we recommend Quake Live if you are looking for a great old school arena shooter. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not limited to the design decisions of 1996</strong> - What can I say? We are ahead of our time. STRAFE® is a mix of old and new design. We didn't want to not imitate the games of the past but instead invoke the feeling of them while bringing fresh ideas to the table. We aim to bring you something new with STRAFE®. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® tries new things with the roguelike FPS formula</strong> - We aim to generate full levels that feel more natural to explore and avoid patterns of rooms that lock you in, teleport in enemies and force you to kill them before the doors unlock. We want STRAFE® to feel like a seamless adventure from start to finish. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not a game that will run well on older computers or laptops</strong> - STRAFE® may look older but it's a new game and features some cutting edge tech. Please check the min spec!<br><br><br>STRAFE® may look like a game you've played but we've worked hard to create a unique and fresh take on first person shooters, we hope you enjoy it!"

Is it the dream game you've been waiting years for or the complete opposite? Review this list carefully as we do not want to waste anyone's time with a game not suited to their tastes:<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> <strong><u>Stash is a complex, deep game that requires skill, thought, and effort to excel.</u></strong> It also takes time to learn. <i><strong>We do not have a guided tutorial</strong></i>. We have guides, videos, in-game tutorial help screens, and both staff and community volunteers who love helping people. If you prefer games with a 1 hour automatic guided tutorial that teaches you how to play, you may have trouble with Stash. <br><br></li><li> <u>Stash embraces the grind.</u> We believe we've made it fun, and it definitely isn't fast. Your accomplishments are meaningful and you won't get passed up if you go on vacation for a week. This goes for combat, crafting, farming, empire building, and pretty much everything.<br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Stash is challenging but approachable.</u></strong> You can make Stash easier with dungeon difficulty settings, partying with other players, or simply focusing on easier content. But some battles can be quite difficult with good strategy and tactics heavily rewarded. Fleeing from battle is not easy or guaranteed. If you die after a certain level, there is a death penalty (you do not lose XP, levels, or items, but instead receive a small amount of XP debt - half your earned XP pays off debt until it is gone, but you can still level up and progress even while you have xp debt!). <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Questing is not a big part of Stash</u>.</strong> We don't like quest grinds. Stash is more of a sandbox-style game. We have quest-type activities (we call them tasks), but they are not a huge focus of the game. The world is open to you to set your own goals and priorities and we do not tell you what you have to do next. <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Crafting and Merchants are big parts of the game</u>.</strong> The best gear in the game is crafted gear, and many systems allow for merchants to play an important role in the economy. <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Your BOO (Base of Operations or house) is a major aspect of character progression.</u></strong> Expanding and upgrading your BOO allows more and faster crafting, more market options, more storage, and more fun. If you love housing then you will probably love Stash.<br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Storage and carrying capacity are part of character progression.</u></strong> Unlocking more bag slots, getting better bags, upgrading your stash, upgrading your stall, and other storage options are all aspects of advancing your character. Some people think this is great. Some people think this is tedious. If it sounds tedious, Stash is not for you. <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>There is no Auction House.</u></strong> Every player has their own merchant stall and can advertise items in the newspapers (which are divided by item category). Our economy encourages people to build their reputation as a merchant or craftsman. Auction Houses are cool but create race to the bottom pricing that leaves little room for sellers to compete on anything other than price. If you like a market that provides opportunities for full time merchants and market arbitrage, you will enjoy Stash. <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Stash is currently light on story, but that is changing fast.</u></strong> You, as a player, will be a huge part of that. Our studio has run a roleplay required, all text MUD for 21 years. Please trust us that story and lore are near and dear to our heart, and will be a huge part of Stash. <br><br></li><li> <strong><u>The World will grow based on player actions.</u></strong> You currently have access to one major capital city, 9 major regions, and 41 dungeons. As the story unfolds, players will open up more of the world. If you prefer an MMO with the entire world available for exploration right away, you might be disappointed. If you like the idea of shaping and unlocking the world as a community, you will be thrilled.<br><br></li><li> <strong><u>We have many unique game mechanics rarely or never seen in other MMOs.</u></strong> We have a fresh take on stat training, healing, character customization, gear upgrading, and many other things. If that sounds fun and interesting, Stash is your game.<br><br></li><li> <strong><u>Stash has only just begun.</u></strong> We are a small team of passionate, indie devs who want to create a game you can call home for many years to come. If you want to be part of that growth, you will love Stash. If you don't want to be part of that journey, you might want to wait a bit.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Extra Packages for Stash</h2><br>There are two packages available which include the game, your $ value worth of Medallions (virtual currency), and some bonus items:<br><br><strong><u>Citizen Package</u></strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Total Value: $22.00<br></li><li> $15 worth of medallions<br></li><li> Mount: donkey<br></li><li> +25% XP Booster (2 hour duration) x2<br></li><li> Healing Potion x5<br></li><li> Mana Potion x5</li></ul><br><strong><u>Founder's Package</u></strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Total Value: $75.00+<br></li><li> $50 worth of medallions<br></li><li> Mount: donkey<br></li><li> +25% XP Booster (2 hour duration) x4<br></li><li> Healing Potion x10<br></li><li> Mana Potion x10<br></li><li> <strong>Founder's Cloak</strong> - Fancy cloak that provides +20% XP until you reach level 20.<br></li><li> <strong>Founder's Monument</strong> - Special outdoor item for your Base of Operations (BOO)<br></li><li> <strong>Founders Weapon Display Case</strong> - Special interior item for your BOO</li></ul><br>Click here for step by step instructions on how to get your medallions and in-game bonus items."

However, it hasn’t regained an advanced stage of development. As a result, the human race, oblivious to its own history, cannot fully comprehend or control the powerful technology at its disposal. The people living in the world of Inner Chains take this situation for granted and focus on using the planet’s resources to their advantage. There is also something that has not changed through the millennia: humans are still subject to basic social issues such as faith, dominance, oppression and manipulation. This led to the emergence of multiple castes, and, in consequence, to the supremacy of one particular group. They had discovered these mechanisms first, learned how to use them well that helped them rise to power. Others had to submit.  <br><br>As one of the inhabitants of this world, your head is filled with the teachings of the Ruling Caste. Your only goal is to get to a mythical place called the Last Hope and leave this degenerated, dying planet once and for all. You embark on your journey full of fanatical zeal, but soon it becomes clear that nothing is what it seems in this strange world. You have to fight for survival, face hostile fauna and flora, and overcome your own weaknesses. You need to stay observant to your surroundings and explore the secrets of the game’s world. Your survival depends entirely on your watchfulness, logical judgment, quick reflexes, accuracy and the ability to use the environment to your advantage.   <br>   <br><strong>   <br>Features  </strong><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Dark biomechanical world with deadly fauna and flora  <br></li><li>Stunning visuals set in dystopian surrealist style    <br></li><li>Variety of challenging opponents   <br></li><li>Breathtaking locations with unique settings  <br></li><li>Atmospheric, tenebrous soundtrack     <br></li><li>Thrilling action combined with intense elements of terror</li></ul>"

You start with a fairly empty map and a few stones where you can place defenders. As the level progresses, more stones appear and some even drop from enemies, allowing you to place them in any valid position on the map. Powerful Warstones also appear occasionally which give significant bonuses to defenders standing on them. You can summon any of the 5 basic defenders on the stones: Peasant, Archer, Rifleman, Sorceress, and Elemental. Each basic defender has its own upgrade path, damage type, gold cost, and special abilities! <br><br><br>Warstone TD also has 2 extra base units only available for use in attack/defense missions, the Eagle and the Wolf. Each have branching upgrade paths, like the basic defenders. With such a variety of defenders and game classes there is a huge amount of tactics in PvP battles, increasing replayability even further!<br><br>There are 30 story missions and each mission has 3 modes: Campaign, Challenge, and Survival. The player can choose the difficulty of each mission from 4 settings: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Nightmare. Each mode has a unique achievement which gives a star when completed, the color of the star corresponds to the difficulty of the mission: gold for Nightmare, silver for Hard, and bronze for Normal. Levels have a lot of possible solutions but, with so many combinations, you're going to need to perfect your strategy to master them. And just in case you forget how awesome you are, there's an online leaderboard, which tracks your score, both in Campaign mode and PvP.

Get born to another player as your mother. Live an entire life in one hour. Have babies of your own in the form of other players. Leave a legacy for the next generation as you help to rebuild civilization from scratch.,"<strong>Note (July 14, 2023):</strong>  I'm back to updating the game weekly, as promised, after taking an extended break to focus on my family.  There have now been 128 weekly updates, with many more to come.  I've been working on this game for more than 7 years now, and it may well be the largest game ever made entirely by a single person.  My goal with these latest updates is to enter the home stretch, fix everything that needs fixing, and implement a satisfying endgame.   --Jason<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Description</h2><br><strong><i>A multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building. Get born to another player as your mother. Live an entire life in one hour. Have babies of your own in the form of other players. Leave a legacy for the next generation as you help to rebuild civilization from scratch.</i></strong><br><br>Hey folks, I'm Jason Rohrer, and I've been working on One Hour One Life for more than three years.  I've been doing everything myself---I drew all the graphics on paper with pens and markers, I coded the entire engine from scratch, I composed and performed all of the music, and I even made all of the sound effects.  It's a very personal game, and it's really unlike anything else that's out there.  It's also a huge game---over 1300 fully interactive, craftable objects already.  And it's only getting bigger, with weekly updates adding new things all the time.  The game was initially released on my own website in February of 2018, and over the intervening months, I released 29 updates off-Steam.  I've promised to keep releasing weekly update for at least the next two years, with the end goal of making the largest, most comprehensive crafting game in history.<br><br>Okay, so what about the game itself?<br><br>First of all, you only live for an hour, where each minute marks a passing year.  You join the game server as a newborn baby, and some other randomly-chosen player is your mother.  You depend on her for your survival.  And why will she be willing to waste her valuable time and resources to keep you alive?  Because she's going to die in an hour just like everyone else, and if she wants what she accomplishes in her lifetime to have any meaning, then the next generation (aka, you) is her only hope.  And if you survive into adulthood, you may get the chance to have babies of your own---other players, just joining the server---and those babies will be the next generation that gives meaning to your own life accomplishments.<br><br>Across this ever-growing family tree of generations, players are collectively conducting an enormous project:  they are rebuilding civilization from scratch.  The online game world starts out as a near-infinite expanse of wilderness (four billion meters wide from east to west, and four billion meters wide from north to south, with a total surface area of over 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 square meters, or 36,000 times bigger than Earth).  The very first player to join the server is Eve, and she starts out in the wilderness as the root of the family tree.  Eve and her immediate offspring lay the foundation for the future civilization, perhaps making a few primitive tools, cooking basic foods, and starting a small farm as they scrape out a meager existence before dying.  Future generations will build on this primitive foundation, eventually mastering more and more advanced technology, including domesticated animals, metal working, permanent buildings, and transportation networks.<br><br>But as real-life history has shown, civilization is fragile.  A generation that is born into the lap of luxury---on the backs of their ancestors' hard-won accomplishments---can just as easily squander their inheritance as build upon it.  Key resources run out over time, so careful management, planning, and organization are necessary to prevent an inevitable collapse.  Thus, the game graduates from the individual challenge of primitive survival in the early stages to a group organizational and leadership challenge in the later stages.  How do rules and procedures for group survival propagate across multiple generations?  What did our great grandparents have in mind for this village?<br><br>The main mode in the game involves being born as a helpless baby to another player as your mother, but you can also play with your friends as twins, triplets, or quadruplets.  One baby is hard enough to take care of---any mother that can successfully take care of quadruplets deserves the eternal gratitude of you and your friends.<br><br>All of this is happening on my own centrally-managed, persistent servers, and your purchase includes a lifetime account on these official servers.  After you buy the game, you can instantly connect to this world with no configuration or server set-up.  It all just works.  You also get access to the full source code, including the server code.  Technically-minded folks can run their own private servers, or even use the powerful content editor to make their own mods. <br><br>I hope you'll join us as this sprawling civilization-building experiment continues to unfold.  Many thousands of players have already collectively lived over 400,000 hours in this endlessly-changing world so far.  Before the Steam release, the average playtime for each player was 17 hours, with dozens of players logging over 500 hours each, and 94% positive off-Steam player reviews.  This is a deep and rich game already, and there are still hundreds of content updates to come.<br><br>No two lives are ever the same, and a new story always awaits on the other side of the [GET REBORN] button.<br><br>Jason Rohrer<br>October 2018<br>Davis, California"

Please read it for tips on how to survive!<br><br><strong>This game makes me feel sick...</strong><br>Unfortunately the feeling of motion sickness just doesn't go away for some people. But that's fine! COMPOUND should be perfectly playable using only teleportation. Also, there are all sorts of comfort options that might help prevent or lessen motion sickness. Please take a look at the options and try various combinations. You might find with a little tweaking you can make it feel right for you."

Le Campus ADN is a publicly-funded vocational school dedicated to video game development.
Every year, three groups are enroled in the programs the Campus delivers : Level design, 3D Modeling, and 3D Animation for games.
After learning the basics of their respective fields during the 2 first trimesters, they join forces during the third one to develop from design to test, a complete playable game.

Each with unique characteristics, units, cultures and histories, the decision of which is best is up to you. Within the borders of this broken land, three clans maintain an uneasy coexistence, fraught with tension and, at times, slavery and open war.<br><br>The Wolf Clan in the northwest, the Lotus Clan high on their northern plateau, and the Serpent Clan in the fertile lowlands. And always, at least in some minds, there is a ghost of a fourth great clan, the lost Dragon Clan, forefathers of the Serpent. Despite their proximity, no three persons could be more different. As yet there is no clear victor in this three-handed struggle; alliances and enmities are unstable, and you never know who or what might be massing on your borders. If you are to survive in this world, you must study your enemies and your friends alike: know their ways, their warriors, and their weaknesses.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">☯ Dragon Clan: The Path of Righteousness</h2>The ancient Dragon Clan prizes honor above everything else. They are Yang followers with honor as their symbol. Their warriors seek to become one with their weapons. Due to their devotion to honor, the Dragon deity assists them during times of great peril.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">☯ Serpent Clan: The Way of the Wicked</h2>A derivative of the Dragon Clan, the Serpent Clan have forgotten their honorable ways and have resorted to thievery and deceit. Serpent clansmen are Yin followers. Unlike their Dragon ancestors, they do not scorn the use of firearms; instead they have learned to employ its use in many of their fighting arts. Even though the Dragon Clan knew how to use gunpowder, it was the Serpent Clan which uncovered its secrets. Stealthy, flexible, and cunning, the Serpent Clan uses a plethora of Battle Gears to disable their opponents and produce an advantage.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">☯ Wolf Clan: The Spirit of Might</h2>The wild Wolf Clan prizes freedom above all else. They are Yang followers with freedom as their symbol. Unlike the other clans, they have no cavalry, nor do they have healers. They feed the horses to their wolves, which accompany them and partake in their battles. Their wounds knit surprisingly fast, even more so with the use of herbs. They know some magic, and much of what they do know is tied to nature. Wolf clansmen are down to earth, hardworking people, and take a delight in nature. They are also known for their use of shale as their armor.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">☯ Lotus Clan : The Essence of Darkness</h2>The Lotus Clan is the remnant of a Yang Clan of old, but it is now a Yin Clan. Lotus clansmen are Yin followers with corruption as their symbol. They follow the Forbidden Path, which focuses on death and decay. Their religion centralizes around three ancient brothers, now long gone, who tended the Tree of Corruption.

They had hearts that knew no fear nor remorse. But none of them came to seek advice of an old man living on the mountain. And--one by one--they failed. Their power crumbled, their dreams vanished, and their lives faded. You are wise to come here, young nobleman. But this is only your first step towards the true wisdom and the true power that only comes with balance...<br><br>Once upon a time there was a proud empire with many great clans. The Serpent Clan ruled this empire while the other clans like the Lotus and Crane maneuvered for greater control of it. It is said, that in those times a great darkness grew from the shadows and formed sinister creatures of pure night. Like droplets of rain they dotted the land and overwhelmed the one clan after another. Tarrant, the leader of the Serpent clan, was the first to accept the fate of the empire. He fled to the south with the remnants of the Serpent Clan and its prized possession, the Dragon Orb.<br><br>Further and further they travelled until he could see the Southern Seas and the end of the land. It was here that he turned and faced the Horde. Summoning all the power of the Dragon Orb, he separated the southern tip of the continent from the rest of the mainland with the awesome power of the orb. Neither it nor he would ever be seen again. The Horde could not cross running water, so Tarrant had saved his people at the cost of his own life and the Orb.<br><br>To this protected place came two other Clans, the Lotus and the Wolf. The Lotus Clan, twisted and corrupt managed to cross to safety by means unknown. The Wolf Clan, whose matriarchal Druidesses foresaw the drowning of their lands by tidal wave (a result of Tarrant breaking the world) built massive arks for their people which rode the surge and shipwrecked on the new formed island.<br><br>How they came to know one another and fight for their piece of the island is the story of Battle Realms!"

This is integrated into Steam soundtrack system, as well as just being in a folder on disk.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Lost Demo</h2>Before we settled on the demo we eventually released, we tried an overly ambitious concept: after defeating the Traffic Warlock in the campaign, Jen and Zan would start glitching forwards in time, glimpsing future content. It culminates in a level where they get to decide both how much of their future they want to see, and also the difficulty of the encounter, by choosing when to seal doors that are spawning enemies and allies from deeper into the game. All while those characters announce their arrival by making meta commentaries on their role in the story or game design.<br><br>Shockingly, this proved too complicated and weird for new players to grasp in the space of two levels, so we ended up building something much simpler.

<br />
Set in late 19th century Japan and England, each title features five murder-mystery episodes filled with all the drama, laughs, twists, and “turnabouts” you’ve come to expect from the legally labyrinthine legacy of Ace Attorney. Join Ryunosuke Naruhodo, ancestor of series mainstay Phoenix Wright, as he attempts to uncover the secrets behind an international criminal conspiracy and solve a hauntingly baffling cold case, while tackling a series of tricky trials along the way. Dozens of hours of attorney action awaits you!<br />
<br />
In the course of each case, you’ll speak to witnesses, examine evidence and clues, and attempt to deduce the dastardly intent behind the crime before proceeding to the courtroom. In court, you will hear testimonies, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. And of course, it wouldn’t be an Ace Attorney game if you couldn’t shout “OBJECTION!” when you know you’ve got the facts and evidence needed to contradict the prosecution’s claims and prove your client’s innocence.<br />
<br />
The game includes a convenient assistance feature in case you hit a dead end in your investigation, so even if this is your first Ace Attorney game, you can get into your amateur sleuthing adventures with ease! Will you be able to crack these clever cases? The game is afoot!<br />
<br />
NOTE: This game can be played with English audio or with Japanese audio and English subtitles."

A place that will give you a lot of fun!</h2><br><strong><i>In Train Station Renovation you play as a renovation company specialised in restoring railway stations. The game is set in abandoned and destroyed train stations, you will start with small rural ones to ease in and eventually be challenged with sprawling train stations in metropolitan areas. The game is divided into 10 maps (stations) which gradually teach you new mechanics and help you manage different working environments. Each station needs to be cleaned, fixed and decorated with items and equipment to bring it back to life. </i></strong><br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1281080/extras/map.gif?t=1672837774"" /><br><br><strong>Choose how hard you want to work.</strong><br>The level of difficulty depends on the player's commitment.

Each specialization offers a unique list of unlockable perks that change the way your creatures fight in battle.<br><br>Here is a list of just a few of the specializations in the game, along with a brief description of how they work:<br><br>Animator - As an Animator, you will always have a unique creature in your party called Animatus. Your entire battle strategy will likely focus on this creature. You can empower your Animatus, and even use your other creatures to make it stronger in combat.<br><br>Cabalist - As a Cabalist, you'll enable your creatures to cast spells that they normally wouldn't have access to. While other people's creatures might run out of Spell Gem Charges, you'll be able to keep your creatures well-stocked with fresh Spell Gems at the start of every battle.<br><br>Cleric - As a Cleric, you'll specialize in healing abilities, as well as buffing, resurrection, stat-boosting effects, and providing your creatures with protective barriers. Your creatures will be extremely difficult to kill.<br><br>Defiler - As a Defiler, you'll specialize in debuffs and stat-reducing effects. Enemies will be so weak that your party will be able to easily pick them off, even if they were originally much more powerful than your creatures.<br><br>Druid - As a Druid, you'll probably only want to have one (or two, later on) creatures in your party. Your creatures will gain massive benefits for being part of a smaller party.<br><br>Evoker - As an Evoker, you'll empower your creatures' spellcasting capabilities. Your creatures will be able to cast the same spell multiple times in one turn, and these spells will be much stronger than if they had cast them without your guidance.<br><br>Hell Knight - As a Hell Knight, you'll favor creatures that specialize in attacking. Hell Knights empower their creatures' attacks with chaotic magic. Hell Knights are surprisingly adept at spellcasting in a pinch, as well.<br><br>Inquisitor - As an Inquisitor, you'll have a solution at your disposal for every problem you encounter. In addition, Inquisitors are able to use healing effects for offensive purposes - for example, when your creatures heal enemies, they instead cause damage to them.<br><br>Monk - As a Monk, you'll boost your creatures' chance to Dodge attacks and spells.

All of them are long since gone, but with the incredible power of virtual reality they can be brought back to life. And this is what the VR Museum was created for. <br />

There are many great inventions that are only known from drawings and blurry photos. And many of them are already 3D-modelled and scattered around the net. The idea behind the VR Museum is to locate them, refurb if necessery, and show here for everyone to see. Starting from airplanes, the Museum's collection will grow to become more interdisciplinary in the future. <br />

<br />
游戏特色：<br />
1.	内政经营模式，享受运筹帷幄的快乐<br />
每年进入一月时就会进入内政经营模式，此时，玩家所占领的城市都会有税收进帐。人口数的提高将使此城能有更多的税收并提高预备兵上限。<br />
<br />
2.	自治施行指令，简化城市探索的繁琐<br />
通过“搜索”指令可以找到武将，更多的是找到诸如武器、马匹、兵符和特殊物品。搜索到的物品和战斗时缴获的战利品可以通过“使用物品”分配给所需武将，用于提高武将的能力或忠诚度。<br />
在城市较多时，也可以用“自治施行”这个指令使某一城市自动使用搜索和开发。但在此模式下找到的物品将不会显示，除非能够找到人才。<br />

The game is full of depth, details and monsters. There are also a huge number of factions, each with its own unique gameplay and magic rituals.<br />
<br />
The main focus in the CoE series is that each race plays differently. We're not talking about a unique building here and a unique unit there, we're talking about completely different playstyles, with different mechanics and different goals. Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern is mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. Perhaps you are a Scourge Lord, who’s pyramids of power drain the very life force from Elysium and channel it to him and his Heralds. With 24 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium.<br />
<br />
New for the 5th version of Conquest of Elysium is four additional planes to interact with, boats and ports which enables players to travel to islands beyond the main continent of Elysium, three new factions, new rituals and summons for the existing factions, new battle maps for different fortifications, new independent factions that fight each other, new monsters, more and different random events, and much more.<br />
<br />
The game has ten different planes. There is for instance an Infernal plane that is the home of the devils and the demons. So if a demonologist manages to summon a demon lord, there will suddenly be a dark citadel without its master in inferno. Banishing a devil will force it back to inferno instead of slaying it permanently. Although extremely difficult it is possible to permanently destroy a demon lord by storming inferno and slaying it on that plane. Although there are many planes you will only rarely have to visit them. But they continue to run in the background and make certain actions or random events more exciting. Among the new planes in CoE5 is the sky-realm above Elysium. From the clouds flying armies might descend upon the inhabitants of Elysium, only to take to the skies and retreat if their losses were significant. But the clouds are not unattainable. Beanstalks, rainbows and tall mountain spires allow ground-born armies to ascend to the clouds.<br />
<br />
Most factions start with a random set of rituals, a random set of combat spells and together with the random map that will ensure that no two games are the same. More rituals and spells can be learned during the game if you have the right resources and find the right locations. In addition to the aggressive wildlife of Elysium there's also random events to contend with, from bumper harvests and bandits, to the very gates of the underworld opening into Elysium. Your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy."

The unicorns mingled among the trees and the elves and humans lived peacefully in harmony with their surroundings. Yet somewhere at the edge of a clearing half-hidden among the trees, obscured by a rising veil of fog in the hazy half-darkness of a weather-beaten hut, a shape huddles over a large and ominously glowing crystal ball. A mumbling voice sings ancient formulae, urging the swirling glowing mists inside the crystal to part and give an insight into the future.<br><br>“All is in flux, nothing seems certain. Come, oh vagaries of space and time, separate the veil and show us what is yet to come”, the voice grumbles with the hint of an eye faintly reflecting the glow in front of its hood. The shape’s audience, only barely visible in the dim light, leans in closer and listens intently. “Time ebbs and flows, forming pools and wrinkles… but when the mists part only vague images rise from beyond the veil. Shhhh—don’t come too close, you don’t want to disturb my delicate magical weavings do you?” The shape, still bent over the orb, mutters and shoos the other back a bit more into the shadows. “Ah, now it seems to be clearing a little. I can see… something… several somethings, hints of voices echoing in the haze. A baby, something happening on Hill Doom and the coming together of the Council of Snots – what could all this mean?”<br><br>In a flash, the light reflected in the eye turns red and a distant evil laughter echoes through the woods.

Famines wreak havoc on the lives of the peasantry, warfare and disunity threaten the social order, noble families fall to decadence and hedonism, and beyond the borders of the old Empire, great armies of pillage and destruction form under the banners of invader-kings.<br><br>In these uncertain times, you must lead your small kingdom to greatness – and the members of your noble family to survival – in this medieval colony sim focussed on generating stories of great valor and vile treachery.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857090/extras/headline_01.png?t=1744896878"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857090/extras/image_02_loop.gif?t=1744896878"" /><br><br>Your family rules from on high, working together – or against one another – to take charge of your city, your kingdom, and your political ploys. Each family member has their own strengths, weaknesses, and ambitions that drive them as they build complex relationships amongst themselves and with foreign rulers. Witness blooming friendships, drunken escapades, and brutal assassinations as your nobles dole out orders to your peasants, lead armies into battle, and study ancient texts brimming with knowledge. <br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> A plethora of skills determine which of your family members are best served performing various tasks – who among them are the greatest warriors, the greatest taskmasters, the greatest scribes, and the greatest negotiators? Seek opportunities to further train their strengths, educating children to secure the future of your line while unlocking additional talent in future generations.<br></li><li> Beyond their skills, each family member has traits that determine their personality and capabilities, varied cultural backgrounds that influence how people perceive and treat them, and a wide range of needs and desires to keep an eye on. Dissatisfaction breeds resentment, envy, and disloyalty, and that’s when the daggers come out. Will you seek to calm tensions through gifts and camaraderie, or will you draw first blood to eliminate any threat to your preferred nobles?<br></li><li> Sometimes the blood you draw belongs to your own kin – driven by ambition, greed, and opportunistic thinking, the members of your family will draw blades against each other given the right circumstances. From scorned lovers and power-hungry siblings to family members influenced by foreign kings and queens, trust is in short supply.<br></li><li> Your kingdom’s capabilities are determined by what your nobles know – they will individually study ancient texts to learn new technologies, and should they perish, that knowledge will be lost with them (unless recorded or passed along to their students). Acquire books in different languages and read them to unlock new buildings, tools, and opportunities for your kingdom. Ensure more of your family members can learn their secrets, translating the texts into a language they speak as needed, preventing a sudden loss of knowledge resulting from a stray arrow. But will you hoard such knowledge in your libraries? Or will you transcribe these writings to trade to others in exchange for immense wealth and resources? After all, knowledge is power…</li></ul><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857090/extras/headline_02.png?t=1744896878"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857090/extras/image_03_loop.gif?t=1744896878"" /><br><br>The common folk of Norland are the backbone of any kingdom, serving their noble lords on the battlefield and around the city with deference and loyalty… until their bellies become empty or the beer runs dry. With different backgrounds, needs, and thoughts of their own, the peasants are difficult to please and easily manipulated into rebellion, crime, and controversy – will you address their complaints as a benevolent lord or answer them with the executioner’s ax?<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Acting through your nobles, tell your peasants where to work, what to prioritize, and when to fight – though you lack direct control over the lower class of your society, they still have hopes, dreams, and relationships of their own. Managing them carefully is critical for success as they are the ones who maintain the complex production chains of your city and are responsible for building structures, harvesting resources, and producing the very goods that keep them satisfied.<br></li><li> Your average peasant will rely on their accrued wealth to lead a fulfilling life. Manage the wages handed out at the end of each day as well as the cost to purchase basic needs like food and beer at the local market to ensure the people stay motivated. High wages and low costs are also an excellent way to encourage migration, but be careful of who you might welcome to your lands.<br></li><li> Peasants hail from different cultures, often at odds with one another, and having them coexist in your small city can be challenging. You can use this friction to your advantage at times, but if the populace has an issue with your noble family’s heritage, you might find hiring additional guards the key to a long life.<br></li><li> Some peasants are devout adherents to the Church of Saint Sophia, and will care most for a noble’s piety, while loyalist peasants simply need enough money to buy food and beer to remain happy. Other factions and sub-factions have different priorities – as you expand and grow stronger, expect these groups to form shifting alliances where they find common ground. Even when they’re formally on your side, though, their actions and methods might not be to your advantage, and you will never escape the consequences of their separate agendas.<br></li><li> When tensions flair, don’t hesitate to establish a nightly patrol, or to give a few unruly members the literal ax. Sending a clear message will often bring the peasants back in line – but do not imagine yourself invincible, as even a great lord is one angry mob away from becoming a head on a pike.</li></ul><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857090/extras/headline_03.png?t=1744896878"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1857090/extras/image_04_loop.gif?t=1744896878"" /><br><br>Norland is set in a rich world with a vibrant past – its inhabitants form a tapestry of different cultural backgrounds with checkered relations, and the power vacuum left in the wake of the Empire’s collapse has given rise to uncertain times. In the distance, an Unholy Horde grows ever stronger, pillaging and burning all in its path, while elsewhere the Church of Saint Sophia uses faith to maintain an iron grip on vast resources.<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> The Empire ruled over a vast tract of land, and its collapse has left behind many successor kingdoms vying for control. Resources vary from kingdom to kingdom, with each potential starting region providing the player different advantages to harness and challenges to overcome.<br></li><li> Send your appropriately-skilled nobles to seek out alliances through marriage, negotiate lucrative trade deals, plot assassinations and kidnappings, and incite rebellions. Will you attempt to recruit spies and conspirators in foreign kingdoms and bring them down from the inside, or do you prefer to settle your differences through force of arms on the open field of battle? And how will you respond when, inevitably, your enemies infiltrate your ranks or bring their armies to your borders?<br></li><li> Watch history play out as events and calamities put you in difficult circumstances from time to time, further complicating the intricate tale of betrayal and bravery that the countless nobles and peasants of Norland weave. From kidnapped relatives to plague-infested refugees, from blackmail to natural disasters, your family will be put to the test throughout the years.<br></li><li> Do not expect the world to sit idly by – traveling nobles will seek refuge or sow dissent, and just as you can send your family members and envoys out to seek opportunities, so too can the other kingdoms of Norland. Bandits will establish camps in the outskirts of civilization as other kingdoms push for alliances and engage in wars of their own.

Keep public order in check and stay on guard against enemies hiding in your midst.<br></li><li> Your warriors are the very people that tend to your fields, brew your ale, and cheer on your executioners – war is not to be taken lightly as valuable lives are risked with each battle. Will you avoid bloodshed at all costs, or are the lives of your people a sacrifice you’re willing to make?<br></li><li> The equipment in your warrior’s hands and on their backs must be either imported or manufactured locally, limiting the makeup of your armies based on your economy – plan ahead before declaring war, and before war is declared on you.<br></li><li> Defend your home against foreign invaders or march across the world map and dive into all-out battle commanding the forces you’ve raised and armed – morale, combat skills, and tactical prowess can determine the victor, but no one is safe in the chaos of clashing steel.</li></ul><br>Through a multitude of scenarios to choose from and a plethora of options that define your nobles and the world around you, Norland allows you to build a society and tell a unique story of any kind – warmongers with penal legions fighting for their freedom, highly educated religious zealots trying to spread the faith, wealthy multicultural idealists hoarding tomes of knowledge, treacherous spymasters plotting assassination and intrigue… what tale will you tell?"
