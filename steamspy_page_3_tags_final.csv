As the undisputed 1999 Game of the Year, Unreal Tournament grabbed the first person shooter genre by the soiled seat of its pants and knocked it around the room with its never-before-seen graphics, brutal edge-of-your-seat gameplay and a massive and varied feature list that gave gamers more than they ever expected.<br>					<ul class=""bb_ul""><li><strong>Novice Mode</strong> - This Botmatch competition is where new flak fodder hit boot camp. The Novice setting makes the computer controlled Bots in the game move slower and inflict less damage with their attacks. For those new to first person shooters, this is where teeth are cut, skills are born and addiction begins... <br>					</li><li><strong>Hardcore Mode</strong> - Strap on extra armor and have a hand towel next to your mouse pad to wipe away the palm sweat. This mode is only for the pros -- all of the bots move like lightning -- dodging, jumping and inflicting A LOT more damage with their standard attacks than do their Novice counterparts. <br>					</li><li><strong>Enhanced Bot AI</strong> - Bots in Unreal Tournament play as if they're jacked up on a big old shot of steroids. Their basic deathmatching skills have been virtually perfected, their understanding of the game rules is professorial, their ability to navigate levels is GPS-like, and their threat to your existence is very real. <br>					</li><li><strong>Radio Chatter</strong> - Each of the commands at your disposal in the game is accompanied by both a text message on screen AND an audio message. Pleas for back-up or for cover fire are accompanied by pre-recorded sequences communicating your needs. Making this especially cool is the fact that you can hear your opponents' messages too (even if you're playing against bots 'cause bots are people, too). <br>					</li><li><strong>New Command Line Options</strong> - For the hardcore server masters, this is the dream way to access features and manage a game. Virtually any option you want to tweak can be accessed via the UT command line. Nice and easy! <br>					</li><li><strong>Improved User Interface</strong> - Unreal Tournament introduced a better way to see what is happening during a game. By using a unique heads up display (HUD) for each game type (Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Domination, and Assault), the game provides ALL the info needed to play effectively WITHOUT bombarding the player with excessive info. <br>					</li><li><strong>UBrowser</strong> - Unreal Tournament's robust Ubrowser system provides the easiest way to find a game on the Internet and jump into battle. The Ubrowser eliminates the need to download third-party server querying applications. It's as simple as one-two-frag. By clicking on the &quot;Play Online&quot; button and then selecting a server from the list, the game is on. <br>					</li><li><strong>Spectator Cams</strong> - Watching a game of Unreal Tournament has the potential to be almost as much fun as playing it. Thanks to the Spectator Cams, gamers can enter a game and hop around to designated Spectator Cams to view the action on the level. Even cooler, the camera can be &quot;attached&quot; to one of the players in the level to view the action from their perspective. Either way, it's a cool feature and a great way to learn for people new to the world of online gaming. <br>					</li><li><strong>Jump Mode</strong> - Jump twice as high as normal. It's sorta' like having a never-ending pair of jumpboots on. The impact these boots have on gameplay is almost indescribable. It changes the dynamic completely.</li></ul>© 2000, Epic Games, Inc.

Dear Esther immerses you in a stunningly realised world, a remote and desolate island somewhere in the outer Hebrides. As you step forwards, a voice begins to read fragments of a letter: &quot;Dear Esther...&quot; - and so begins a journey through one of the most original first-person games of recent years. Abandoning traditional gameplay for a pure story-driven experience, Dear Esther fuses its beautiful environments with a breathtaking soundtrack to tell a powerful story of love, loss, guilt and redemption.<br><br>Forget the normal rules of play; if nothing seems real here, it’s because it may just be all a delusion. What is the significance of the aerial -- What happened on the motorway -- is the island real or imagined -- who is Esther and why has she chosen to summon you here? The answers are out there, on the lost beach, the windswept cliffs and buried in the darkness of the tunnels beneath the island… Or then again, they may just not be, after all…<br><br>Dear Esther is supported by Indie Fund.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key features:</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Every play-through a unique experience, with randomly generated audio, visuals and events.<br></li><li>Explore Incredible environments that push the Source engine to new levels of beauty.<br></li><li>A poetic, semi-randomised story like you've never experienced in a game before.<br></li><li>Stunning soundtrack featuring world-class musicians.<br></li><li>An uncompromisingly inventive game delivered to the highest AAA standards.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Soundtrack</h2>Jessica Curry's haunting and beautiful soundtrack to Dear Esther, now available on Steam, has been a hit with gamers and critics alike.

Exquisitely constructed, both sonically and visually&quot; (Eurogamer), &quot;as beautiful as the game is, it’d be remiss not to mention Curry’s atmospheric soundtrack...impossible to ignore.&quot; (Edge), &quot;spellbinding, fascinating aural landscape: a resounding success&quot; (Square Enix), &quot;Curry's delicate &amp; understated musical score achieves a level of excellence. It's the ultimate achievement of composition.&quot; (Bitgamer). The soundtrack was shortlisted for the Excellence in Audio award at the Independent Games Festival 2012"

You’ll often find yourself on the edge, hearing and seeing ghostly things, trying to find keys and items to help in your escape. And sometimes you’ll find yourself running desperately from a monster, who’s there only to find and kill you and your friends. <br>You’ll also be able to play as the monster. The game will feature different monsters, each one unique in its gameplay and hunting style.<br><br>- What kind of horror game is Damned? <br><br>Damned explores the sense of being defenseless against a powerful supernatural force. The survivors can’t directly affect the monster in any way. When it’s there to get you, your only chance is to run and hide. <br>This perception of being defenseless is very strong, primal and terrifying, it builds up anxiety and makes you really scared, fearing any unexplained noise or movement. <br>This is how Damned creates horror in a multiplayer game session, and we believe it to be super effective! (tested and approved!) <br><br>- Why is Damned a randomized game? <br><br>Every stage in Damned is randomized: <br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Almost all the objects in a stage may or may not appear; <br></li><li>The item system is fully random too, randomizing which item will appear in the game, and where it'll be; <br></li><li>The way to win a match as a survivor is also randomized;<br></li><li>Even the stage may trigger random events to scare the survivors inside.</li></ul><br>- Why is Damned a competitive and cooperative game? <br><br>Because in a full game, with 4 survivors and 1 monster, there’ll be a survivor “team” cooperating to try and escape together, and at the same time they’ll be competing against a monster, trying to flee from him and deny each one of its attempt to hunt and kill a survivor. <br><br>- How to play as a survivor? <br><br>As a survivor you’ll be cooperating with your friends (up to 4 survivors in a single game session): <br>You and your friends will be searching the level for keys and items to help in your escape; <br>Each survivor will have a flashlight that can be turned on and off, helping you see your surroundings, but at the same time letting the monster know where you are; <br>The survivors will be able to manipulate objects throughout the hotel, like drawers, doors, safes, cabinets, wardrobes; <br>Challenge yourself to find the exit and get out alive.<br><br>- How to play as the monster? <br><br>As the monster, your game will be all about competing alone against the survivors team. <br>The game will feature different monsters, each one unique in its play style. It's up to you to play a few rounds with each monster and decide which one works best for you.<br>How are you going to hunt and kill the survivors?<br><br>- Why is Damned worth buying? <br><br>Because it’s fun! <br>It’s really scary, you’ll find yourself on the edge a lot of times, trying to evade the monster or trying to pay closer attention because you don’t know if the sound you just heard is some random noise or if it is the monster haunting you. <br>It’s a real horror game, it explores deeply the feeling of being completely defenseless against a powerful force that can finish you easily. Your only choice is to run and hide! <br>And also because it’s really fun to play as the monster as well. You’ll keep haunting and building up anxiety in people, making them terribly scared of you.

Tiny maps, large maps, five minute missions, five day missions...  the simulation scales to handle all of these scenarios.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">User generated content is critical and supported at multiple levels in Creeper World 3.</h2>  Dial up worlds using the DMD (Dial Map Device) and tweak dozens of constraints.  Then, play and share the addresses via an on-line database.  Create your own maps using the built-in map editor and upload and share on-line.  Or, join with thousands of other players and peruse the databases of worlds created by others.  Want to create a new weapon, a unit, an enemy, or an effect?  Use the built in scripting language to create what you dream.  Hundreds of engine commands are exposed and examples abound on the forums and grow daily.  You can even take the built in story maps and make your own.  In fact, all of the built in story missions were written using the built-in editor and the CRPL scripting language.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Some of the high level features are:</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Thermodynamic/fluid physics based play.<br></li><li>Billions of total missions.<br></li><li>Story arc with insane and unique enemies.<br></li><li>Explore hundreds of star systems with thousands of worlds in Prospector missions.<br></li><li>Hundreds of hand crafted missions in the Alpha Sector.<br></li><li>Dial up your own mission worlds using the 'Dial Map Device' and share the address.<br></li><li>Create your own maps using the included map editor.<br></li><li>Play on maps of variable size, dimension, and shape.<br></li><li>Script your own enemies and effects using the built in scripting language.<br></li><li>Terraform the landscape during missions to take the higher ground.<br></li><li>Discover experimental weapons that devastate the enemy.<br></li><li>Share thousands of unique maps with an established, enthusiastic on-line community.<br></li><li>Features a unique, original, and awesome soundtrack.</li></ul>"

The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination.,"What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds. The Core and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fuelled by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the other.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Story / Background </h2>In the distant future, the galaxy is ruled by a central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core (a contraction of &quot;Consciousness Repository&quot;). The Core's technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize most of the Milky Way and enjoy peace and prosperity. However, the balance is broken by a technological breakthrough that allows the consciousness of a human being to be reliably transferred into a machine, thereby theoretically granting infinite life, in a process called &quot;patterning.&quot; Following a mandate imposed on humanity by the Core requiring everyone to undergo patterning as a public health measure, a rebel band is formed out of colonies from the edges of the galaxy (hence their name, the Arm), whose members refused to leave their natural bodies to join the Core's machines. A war lasting 4,000 years followed, with the Arm mass-producing clones as pilots for its vehicles and the Core duplicating consciousness-embedded microchips to pilot its own machines.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key information </h2>Total Annihilation (TA) is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game created by Cavedog Entertainment under the guidance of lead designer Chris Taylor. It was released on September 30, 1997, and was the first RTS game to feature 3D units and terrain. Two expansion packs were released: The Core Contingency on April 30, 1998, and Battle Tactics exactly 2 months later on June 30, 1998. When TA was released, the minimum computer requirements were a Pentium 100 MHz processor and 16 MB of RAM. Of course, these requirements were for computers in 1997; modern day machines easily exceed those recommended specifications, but it is still recommended to have a 1 GHz processor and 512 MB of RAM for the updated game engine.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Game features </h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul"">Upon release, the original TA game boasted:	<li>Fully-articulated 3D units and buildings, with a diverse complement of unit types — for example, aircraft, amphibious tanks, infantry bots (kbots), vehicles, hovercraft, ships, submarines, unit production factories, powerful stationary defenses, and long-range weapons. A unique tracking feature allows players to follow single units, entire armies, or even projectiles across the landscape.	<br>	</li><li>True 3D terrain that units can climb over, into, and around, on extra-large 3D-generated maps. TA runs comfortably in high resolutions and even on modern dual monitor setups, so players can see more of the battlefield.<br>	</li><li>Numerous world types to do battle on, such as grasslands, forests, deserts, archipelagos, open water, lava, metal, ice, crystal, acid, and even moons.<br>	</li><li>More than 150 official units and 25 official missions per side in a single player campaign. The Core Contingency expansion pack added 75 new units (including the infamous Krogoth), 50 new maps, 25 new missions, and 6 new world types. Battle Tactics added 4 new units, 6 new maps, and 100 new missions. A final patch (version 3.1c, and included here) added 6 new units, including a resurrection kbot!<br><br>	</li><li>Detailed and exciting campaigns that focus on their respective side's leaders, the Commanders. The stories of either the Core or the Arm start with an effort to defend the protagonist's home world and initiate a turning point in the war, followed by a series of battles on numerous planets and moons (using Galactic Gates as a form of faster-than-light transportation), before a final strike on the enemy's home world: either on the Arm's bucolic Empyrean or the Core's artificial Jupiter Brain world of Core Prime. Mission objectives include protecting a vital structure or area, capturing a pivotal enemy unit, or simply eliminating all enemy units. More powerful units and weapons are gradually unlocked throughout the campaigns after specific missions or events.<br><br>	</li><li>Single-player skirmish battles and full multiplayer support, allowing players to watch and join battles, and form allied teams to share resources, information, and units.<br>	</li><li>Highly advanced weaponry, including lasers, energy machine guns (EMGs), starburst missiles, plasma shells, lightning pulses, paralyzers, and nuclear warheads.<br>	</li><li>Variables such as gravity, tides, and wind to disrupt the effectiveness of certain weapon types or to enhance resource production.<br>	</li><li>Intelligence measures to detect or jam enemy units using radar and sonar, the ability to cloak or provide stealth shielding for units, and the means to revive destroyed units from their wreckages.<br>	</li><li>Over the years, the TA community has created literally thousands of third-party units and hundreds of maps to customize a player's TA experience. Numerous utilities, missions, mods, and factions have also been created to rebalance or totally convert the game; many of these units are still in competitive online and skirmish play today. Modern modifications to the game push the venerable 16-year-old TA engine to new limits with complex scripting, allowing for mass unit transporting, instant map-wide teleportation, upgradeable units, and true shields — plus much more. </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">More information </h2>"

Most perks are designed to change the way you have to play or the weapons you'll want to use. Do you want more speed in exchange for less health, or maybe is better to have mana regeneration? Increase drop rate, or refill ammo here and now? No number game here, simple and direct choices.<br />

We've also ensured that, as a proper FPS game, the experience is quick and direct. There's no inventory to manage or the need to compare two almost equal item drops, just weapon selection, and mana/health are usually the bargaining chip.<br />

A whole arsenal of magic and alchemic weapons will be at your disposal. Wreak havoc among your enemies, but watch your mana reserves or you might regret it later!<br />

Since then, it's accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new UI, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. Caves of Qud has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations.

Scattered worlds were claimed on the fringe of the galaxy. Each pocket of survivors held on to an isolated set of worlds while trying to rebuild under the great law of Shalun.

The hyperwarp reestablished the transportation of cargo, goods, and technologies between the quadrants – but it has also brought great strife. Political rivalries have been rekindled, blood has been shed in age-old feuds, and the fires of war have been stoked.

In a game like that it doesn't matter how many times you test and tweak the layout to make your map the best it can be, or how abstract the level becomes as a result.

Unfortunately thanks to Apple we now can't update this version any further and it may be removed at some point from the store.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Contradiction is a unique adventure / murder mystery game that uses live-action video for the entirety of the game play.  All you have to do is interview characters, spot their lies and catch them out!

Contradiction is a brand new take on the concept of an interactive movie and brings the genre to a whole new level of playability.  It plays as smoothly as a 3D graphic game. You can wander freely around the game environment, collecting evidence and witnessing constantly changing events. 

But the game is all about interviewing the characters you meet, questioning them about all the evidence you’ve collected and things you’ve seen, then spotting contradictions in their answers.  Pair two contradictions together and watch them try to worm out of it!

Works best plugged into a TV preferably with a bunch of people to help spot the lies - but can be played alone on your laptop or PC just fine!

Little or no information was left intact, as most online and written accounts of the creature were mysteriously destroyed. <br />
Witnesses told stories of their encounters with a creature of unknown origin. Emotions ranged from extremely traumatic levels of fright and discomfort. <br />

the country in search of poltergeists,Bigfoot, Mothman and other American legends...exploring haunted houses, trekking through creepy bushy  forests and scanning the sky and lakes to collect data about the mystical events...  <br />
<br />
So, you are in the place where the strange humanoid - Rake was most frequently seen. Most often he was seen at night. Therefore, you can use the cameras, motion sensors, night vision device for the strange phenomena detection. In the afternoon you are installing equipment in all areas of the forest. You can also mount the cameras on animals, if you manage to lure them into a trap. At nightfall your task is to watch on the monitor for events taking place in the forest. You can switch between the cameras. If you notice something unusual, you can go to a place where the camera has spotted the creature. Do not forget to take a rifle. So you have to hunt down a strange creature, and then kill it or trap it. However, be careful, it can disrupt your plans ... And while watching on the monitor, be aware, it could be closer than you think. The game is over, when you will it... or it kills you... <br />

It may not look serious, but we guarantee, that it is. Kopanito’s match engine is well-balanced and entirely skill-based.","<h1>Early Access Summary</h1><p>Kopanito is now more than 2 years in constant development. <strong>Everything started back in July 2014</strong>. For the first year the game was developed internally and then we decided to hit Steam Greenlight. <strong>This is also our first game!</strong><br><br>This post is a short summary of the whole Early Access period, which is now ending (and we like summaries). Leaving Early Access is a big milestone for us too.<br><br>If you've monitored the game's progress for some time, then this post may give you a better picture of the whole development process overall. Hopefully you will find this lecture interesting.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>The Idea behind Kopanito</strong></h2><br>So why to make an arcade 2D football game in 2016? We've started working on the game in 2014. From our research it appeared that there weren't many popular arcade football games available on Steam. And having a choice is a good thing.<br><br>Clear inspirations for the game were classics such as <strong>Nintendo World Cup</strong> (graphics, crazy super-moves), <strong>Sensible Soccer and Kick Off</strong> (skill-based gameplay). We've spent countless hours on these games 20 years ago ːkopanitosmileː So why not to make something similar today?<br><br>What does skill-based mean? It means, that you need to learn the game's mechanic over time (like in real life football). You need to work out your precision and reflexes to be a better player. Luck means little in Kopanito. The better player just wins and there aren't footballer stats that can help you. You are the stats. Super-moves also are skill-based, the better you play, the more of them you gain during a match. Some super-moves can neutralize opponent's super-moves.<br><br>Kopanito is also a game that we wanted to play. <strong>To bring back fun to football games</strong>. <strong>We've made it with love</strong>, working sometimes on weekends or in overtime, being vocal on the forums and responding to the issues reported.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Greenlit in 2015</strong></h2><strong>17-26 August 2015</strong><br><br>Kopanito is on Steam thanks to the Steam Greenlight process and <strong>votes by the community</strong>. The 9 voting days were very stressful for us (as probably for most indie devs). You can still see the original Kopanito's Greenlight page and how the game looked like in 2015:<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Early Access</strong></h2><strong>17 September 2015 - v0.2</strong><br><br>Kopanito has been released initially on Windows and OS X (Linux support came later).<br><br>At start there were 104 national teams in the game, 7 stadiums, 4 super-moves, practice mode, friendly matches, 7 tournaments and local multi-player. The graphics were a little simpler. There was no higher AI levels, only the beginner AI.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Pixel Heaven and Poznań Game Arena 2015</strong></h2><strong>September &amp; October 2015</strong><br><br>These are two gaming events organized in Poland. Pixel Heaven takes place in Warsaw and PGA takes place in Poznań (our home town).<br><br>It was great time and first occasion to observe how a greater audience react to the game. There were guys playing, kids playing and even girls playing the game and had great fun!<br><br>Kopanito got 5 awards during these events: <i>Best Gameplay, Big Bang!, Retro Roots, Revelation and Grand Prix</i>. The last one awarded by the audience votes, the rest awarded by the jury.<br><br>► Pixel Heaven 2015: preparations, first day, second day, awards<br><br>► Poznań Game Arena 2015: preparations, first day, second day, tournament, third day, award<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Difficulty levels, more tournaments and teams</strong></h2><strong>25 November 2015 - v0.3</strong><br><br>Previously only the beginner AI was available, but now there are 3 more, giving a total of four of them: <strong>beginner, amateur, professional and legend</strong> (the last one must be unlocked).<br><br>This was first time when the game was available on <strong>Linux and Steam OS</strong>.<br><br>Kopanito got translated back then to several languages, but later we've decided to remove translations until game's features will 'settle'. Localization support will return soon.<br><br>Other stuff added:<br>► <strong>9 more competitions</strong> to complete: Pacific League, Microstates Cup, Central American and Caribbean League, Pan Arab League, Commonwealth Cup, Pan American League, Mediterranean League, Continental League and World League,<br>► <strong>10 new teams</strong>: Angola, Bulgaria, India, Israel, Luxembourg, Morocco, Northern Ireland, Puerto Rico, Republic of Ireland and Thailand.<br>► The <i>&quot;How to play&quot;</i> guide in the game.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Leaderboards and match challenges</strong></h2><strong>21 December 2015 - v0.4</strong><br><br>The leaderboards in Kopanito were organized into <strong>4 leagues: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum</strong>.<br><br>Playing matches (alone or in co-op or online) gives you fame points. Completing <strong>match challenges</strong> (see the image below) will give you even more fame. The more fame you have, the higher you will be in the global ranking. Advancing to a higher league requires to accumulate given amount of fame shown on the leaderboards screen, different for each league. Each league is also limited in capacity.<br><br><strong>Match challenges</strong> are additional objectives that can be completed during a tournament match (against AI).

It took several weeks to paint them by our illustrator.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Achievements and custom tournaments</strong></h2><strong>29 January 2016 - v0.5</strong><br><br>The Trophies screen got added to Kopanito with 225 achievements to complete (later reduced to 224). Most of the achievements are quadruple (bronze, silver, gold and platinum), so for example winning Oceania Cup on the Legend difficulty level gives you 4 achievements (one per difficulty level). There are <strong>70 unique achievements</strong>.<br><br>Custom Tournament is a <strong>perfect thing for parties with friends</strong>. Each friend controls one national team and you organize a cup for them, eg. World Cup, European Cup or Champions League. This is basic, but you can also do more crazy stuff, as there may be more than one human per team.<br><br>Custom Tournament can be started in one of the three formats:<br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>League (round-robin) with 4-16 teams,<br></li><li>Knock-out stage only with 4, 8 or 16 teams,<br></li><li>Group stage with knock-out stage with 12-32 teams. </li></ul>You can specify number of human and AI teams participating and decide how well AI will play. Progress of the competition will be saved, so you can also make longer session or more parties!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Freeze super-move, replays and GIF generator</strong></h2><strong>1 April 2016 - v0.6</strong><br><br>The new (back then) <strong>Freeze super-move</strong> allows you to embed nearby players in an ice-block (except goalkeepers). Note that you may also freeze your teammates too. Frozen players wont participate in the game for some time. You can slide tackle a frozen teammate to defrost him faster. <br><br>The ball can also be frozen or, actually stopped, even in mid-air. It's a good method to cancel opponent's shots, including super-shot. Try it for yourself :)<br><br>Also <strong>action replays</strong> got added, activated automatically after goals. It's a side-product of online multi-player which was then in development. Up to last 8 seconds are recorded and can be replayed back.<br><br>An action replay also can be processed into a <strong>GIF animation</strong>. This feature was inspired by the first GIF animation uploaded by one of the community members. Greater collection of player-generated GIFs can be seen on the Artworks section of the Community Hub.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Headers, bicycle kicks and manual passes introduced</strong></h2><strong>10 June 2016 - v0.7</strong><br><br>This update introduced important gameplay improvements. We've added <strong>headers and bicycle kicks</strong> to the game and modified the ground passes to work similarly to lob passes.<br><br>The game got more challenging too by adding manual passes (previously these were assisted). Manual passes require more precision, but also introduced more diversity in pitch situations. Kopanito got even more skill-based. The more you play, the better you are.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Online multi-player introduced</strong></h2><strong>17 August 2016 - v0.8</strong><br><br>The big day has come. It took us a few long months to implement the online modes on an already working game (which is harder to do than doing in it from the start).<br><br>You can play with other players around the world in quick match modes: Duel (1 vs 1), Doubles (2 vs 2), Chaos (3 vs 3), Complete (5 vs 5).<br><br>The Create Party mode allows to customize an online match by choosing teams, stadium, decide of the match duration and invite friends to play against.<br><br>Neat feature is that local friends can participate in online modes too.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Indoor stadium</strong></h2><strong>1 September 2016</strong><br><br>The new Indoor Stadium has walls around. It means that there are no throw-ins, corner kicks and goal kicks during a match, the game is faster this way. A tournament taking place in this stadium is present in the game too.<br><br>Adding this stadium to the game is a direct result of the poll organized in the game's Community Hub on Steam. Thanks everyone for voting!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ <strong>Halloween teams, improved corners, automatic passes</strong></h2><strong>28 October 2016 - v0.9</strong><br><br>4 new teams have been added to the game related to Halloween: <strong>Vampires, Zombies, Werewolves and Pumpkins</strong>.<br><br>Corner kicks now allow for more options. You can make a ground pass, a lob pass or a precise shot at the goal.<br><br>The automatic (assisted) passes are back in this update but along with the manual passes.

It means, that you need to learn the game's mechanic over time (like in real life football). You need to work out your precision and reflexes to be a better player. Luck means little in Kopanito. The better player just wins and there aren't footballer stats that can help you. <strong>You are the stats</strong>.

Some super-moves can neutralize opponent's super-moves.<br><br>It may not look serious, but we guarantee, that it is. Kopanito's match engine is well-balanced. Use slide tackle to intercept passes or knock-down opponents (or even score a goal!). Pass the ball straight to your teammates (ground or air) or pass the ball between opponents. Score goals using chip shots or by swerving the ball using slow-motion shots. There are various set pieces, like corner kicks or throw-ins too, but no rules apart from that! Don’t forget, it is a fast-paced game - it might be funny and cartoonish, but it’s not that easy. Try it yourself!<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ Crush your opponent with a super-move</h2>If you play well-enough, you will be awarded with a <strong>super-move</strong>. Then you can pull the ball using a super-strong magnet (because why not) or teleport into a different spot on the field, activate a big windmaker to blow things out of your goal-line, perform a super-shot that knockout opponents down on the path of the ball and freeze your opponents with the freeze super-move.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">⚽️ Try it with your friends</h2>There is support for up to <strong>5 controllers</strong> (4 gamepads + keyboard). Try the game with your buddies in a friendly match in various game modes – in any desired combination including 5 vs AI game or play in cooperation through a tournament. You can create own tournaments (league, knockout or league + knockout). You decide about stadium, ball and number of teams.

The modern engine has been built specifically with Starbase in mind and the engine’s architecture is designed to handle all the quirks of simulation, damage, building, player amounts and the ever-growing universe to match the challenges the ambitious vision of the game can pose. Similarly, all features of the game have been developed with the infinite scale and the creative freedom of the players in mind.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Starbase has been in secret development for five years without restraints and the development will continue until the game’s bold vision is achieved. In the ever-expanding space the scale can range from the unit of one bolt to massive space station structures, with exploration missions varying from journeys to nearby asteroid fields, to salvaging ship debris, and eventually to other galaxies.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">In Starbase players are given the freedom to build the kind of universe they want to, and a small group of players can eventually form large factions that challenge the powers that be. Being inventive will also help, as cleverness often triumphs over brute force in Starbase, and the only limitation is the creativity of the players.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Early Access</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Starbase Early Access will introduce the players, the pioneers, to a new galaxy that they can begin to explore from a bunch of huge stations located at the orbit of a single planet. As the players eventually settle the entire orbit, they can start finding ways to travel to the planet’s moons and someday all the way to other planets and distant star systems. The still unoccupied universe of Starbase offers players the chance to take part in the building of the galaxy and in discovering what will be the first steps in the twilight of space travel. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Early Access allows the players to design, build &amp; modify spaceships, explore the universe, form social connections, and earn money by mining, gathering, crafting and selling resources. The players can start building their home stations and begin the expansion of the Starbase universe together with the developers.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Starbase launches into Early Access in a clear alpha stage, however the core features are well established and there's fun to be had for sure.

You have full control over the army composition. Based on your successes and reputation you might get access to more corps, divisions and brigades. Keep your soldiers alive and they will learn to fight better, turning from green rookies to crack veterans. Lose a lot of your soldiers and you might not have enough reinforcements to deliver victories. Your reputation will suffer, army morale will drop and you will be forced to resign.<br><br><strong>Innovative command system: </strong>You decide which level of control you want. Command every unit individually or just give them a main goal with one button click and watch if they can take that hill. Army divisions commanders can make decisions on their own and help you control the largest army. Draw a defensive line and allocated brigades will defend it like lions. Or design a deep flanking maneuver by just drawing an arrow and send the whole army to the enemy flank or the rear. Your generals will try to fulfill your orders, although &quot;no plan survives contact with the enemy&quot;.<br><br><strong>Officer progression: </strong>Historical unit commanders progress and become better fighters together with the player. The Officers rank up based on their units’ performance, but it's war and they can be wounded or even get killed in action. New ranks open new possibilities and allow officers to lead bigger units without efficiency loss. Winning battles also opens new possibilities for you as a general, increasing skills such as reconnaissance or political influence.<br><br><strong>Historical weapons: </strong>There is huge variety of Civil War weaponry from mass produced Enfield pattern rifles to rare Whitworths. Historical availability has also been implemented. Certain weapons can only be captured by raiding supplies or taken from the enemy on the battlefield. <br><br><strong>Enhanced unit control: </strong>Detach skirmishers to send them to scout those hills ahead. Or merge several brigades into one bigger division if it’s needed. Dismount the cavalry to become less visible to the enemy or mount for fast flanking charges and supply raids. Supplies are extremely important and you have to plan and defend the provisions otherwise the battle might end for you early.<br><br><strong>Advanced Artificial Intelligence: </strong>You will face a strong enemy. AI will flank you, will hit your weak spots and undefended high ground, will chase and cut your supplies and will try to destroy unguarded artillery batteries. AI will use terrain and will take cover and retreat if overwhelmed. <br><br><strong>Terrain matters: </strong>Trenches, lines, fences, houses, fields – everything can help to achieve victory, if you know how to use it. Hills will allow you to see enemy units earlier. Rivers and bridges can become natural obstacles that will help you to defend. Forests can help you hide your movements and flank the enemy. <br><br><strong>Beautiful maps: </strong>We believe that modern technology allows hardcore war-games to finally stop being brown on green hexes. Hardcore, deep war games can be beautiful. In our game, every historical battle landscape is accurately hand-drawn, utilizing data from satellite and historical maps. The topography plays immense strategic role and helps to understand how battles were fought and to learn history."

540900,"['Single-player', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Family Sharing']","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Indie']",Nuclear Contingency is a top down action stealth game set during the height of the cold war.,"It is the year 1959, the world is drastically changing in the aftermath of the Korean War and the death of the Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin. The power balance of the world is forever altered by the discovery of the destructive A-bomb. From former British colonies in the South East Asia, US spies came back with the disturbing news of communist insurgents creating nuclear weapons. Nobody knows how they got their hands on uranium to fuel such a weapon and the required knowledge to make it. Faced with the dangers that communist terrorists could pose to the US and it's allies, the CIA Directors have decided to send their top man, Jack MacArthur to investigate the rumors and if they are proven true, to sabotage the nuclear capabilities of the terrorists. Still haunted by the horrors of the Korean War, Jack sets forth to eliminate the threat not only to the US, but to the whole world.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nuclear Contingency is a stealth game inspired by the old school top down spy titles (such as the Metal Gear series). A deep and compelling story line spread across a period of 4 years will constantly keep you on your toes while you travel across exotic locations of Vietnam, Kongo, Cuba, Afganistan and more. Be prepared for an intriguing political thriller filled with unforeseeable twists and turns. Playing as a top field operative, players will be tasked with completing various missions by using stealth or confronting  enemy soldiers head on. However, if alerted, the guards will prove to be a great challenge as a single bullet is enough to send Jack to an early grave. Only with a stealthy, smart approach, cool head and steady aim will the player be able to complete the mission and put an end to a nuclear threat, bringing back peace to the world.<br />
<br />
Whats next'<br />
<br />
We still wish to work on the game and improve certain ai mechanics. For now we still have not figured out why the AI sometimes breaks. Please let us know about everything you would like to see improved so we can put it in the upcoming patch!<br />
Final note- During beta testing we have come across one weird but fun bug. The map is for some unknown reason filled with blood like someone before played the level... We found this interesting and we have no idea what causes the bug so if someone sees this please let us know so we can maybe figure out what causes the Massacre bug."

All the girls are under your command. Lead your army, won the war!","Metal Waltz<br />
is a military strategy game in multi-language, currently supports Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, and Russian.<br />
<br />
Background story<br />
In 194X, human created a new creature, which were combined with animals and tank components, called Beast Tanks. This new kind of creature had amazing power, they were controlled via radio waves. Beast Tanks can be used for agricultural production and other production activities, of course, including war. However, one day human suddenly lost control of the Beast Tanks. The runaway Beast Tanks conducted destruction everywhere in the whole world, brought the human being an unprecedented catastrophe... ...<br />
Metal Maidens are the only hope of the human being to defeat the Beast Tanks.<br />
Metal Maidens is the product of the Walküre Project, which aims to transform humans in a similar fashion to Beast Tanks; with the same capabilities or better. Metal Maiden technology is divided into two types -- Body modification and Attires. <br />
Body Modification --A Metal Maiden core (an improved Beast Tank core) is implanted into the body, vastly improving the human body's limits and expanding neural networks to allow for control of external armor and appendages. <br />
Attires -- Armored combat attires similar to a Beast Tank's, developed as a robust and reliable armor utilizing their new capabilities; however, some attires are specifically developed for and only correspond to a specific type of Metal Maiden core.<br />
As a side note: Men are, for some mysterious reason, unable to utilize any core at all, but not all women are able to as well; so both the selection and testing are rigorous and stringent.<br />
Some scholars believe the Metal Maidens are a new kind of creature. Some say that the Metal Maidens technique will lead to the fundamental change in mankind.<br />
<br />
In the world of Metal Waltz you are a commander. You lead the Metal Maidens to fight against the Beast Tanks and explore the secrets behind the Beast Tanks at the same time.<br />
<br />

<br />
3. In the early development phase, the development team flew to France to visit the famous tank museum Saumur Musee Des Blindes to study tanks. In the museum the team took over 5000 photos of the tanks.<br />
Museum administrator: &quot;The museum will be closed soon. I've urged you three times to leave. I have to pick up my daughter after work. You know?&quot;<br />
<br />
4. There are over 250 different tanks from the period from WW2 to the early Cold War.<br />

<br />
A TILE PLACEMENT GAME OF CREATING LANDSCAPES, CLAIMING AREAS, AND GAINING POINTS<br />
<br />
Carcassonne is a modern classic tile-placement game based on the award wining game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, et cetera. The player can then decide to place one of his followers, so called Meeples, on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner. Each new game is a new experience thanks to the ever-changing landscape.<br />
<br />
ENJOY FUN AND TACTICAL GAMEPLAY<br />
<br />
During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, making it harder for him to complete his goal and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br />
<br />
FEATURES<br />
<br />
• 5 expansions to shake up your games with new tiles, meeples and rules<br />
• 1 Free expansion: The Abbot<br />
• Solo mode<br />
• Pass &amp; Play on the same device with your friends and family               <br />
• Detection of blocked locations once the tile is placed.<br />
• Online multiplayer mode includes:<br />

With skill combinations, you've got almost limitless options. <br>There's a huge selection of over 70 monsters, as well as a few giant bosses to conquer, in addition to over a hundred missions to complete. <br> <br>We've also added some unique mechanics to the game. One example is having to lure bosses out of hiding, using food to entice them. Offer them something sweet, then destroy them.  <br>When you craft different weapons and equipment, you'll notice that each one has its own attributes and skill bindings. The weapon crafting also has an element of luck, so you never know when you might just luck out and craft the perfect weapon.  <br>Also, what weapon crafting game would be complete without additional enchanting mechanics to further imbue your equipment with even more raw power.  <br> <br>In addition to crafting and making money, you can also send your staff members on auto-battle journeys where they'll earn materials for you as they progress deeper and deeper into dungeons. You'll see your materials building up, but pay attention to the health of your staff. If you feel there's a chance they might die, you can run from battle at any time and keep any materials they've already earned from that journey.  <br> <br>We hope, whatever you decide to do in the game, that you have a great time doing it.  <br> <br>Sincerely, <br>Digdog Studios Ltd."

He reacts to your placements, and uses his virtuous mind to select the safest path!

In those titles, you help friendly unintelligent characters to build paths and reach a goal, while in Stratside you prevent a much more clever character (the enemy) from reaching his objective.<br><br>Stratside is also a defense game, but whilst traditional defense games feature a large number of dummy enemies with predictable paths, Stratside's smarter enemy is much harder to catch, and powerful enough to move colossal planets through space! Unlike many defense games, Stratside does not make you click on gadgets in real-time to make them attack, here they are auto-battlers!

A brief sprint helps create some distance so the Hider can morph into a new object and vanish again. It can even vaporize a small percentage of its body to create a smoke screen that leaves a gelatinous residue on the Seeker's ocular unit. Once enough goo has been collected, the Hider can take over the Seeker by assimilating it into the glorious mass the Hider has become.

A high-tech squirt gun dilutes the Hider's goo until it is weak enough to be captured. A tracking grenade causes a chemical reaction on contact with the Hider that will cause it to leave a trail behind it for a short time. The Seeker can even detect how far away the Hider is, displaying the data on a hot-and-cold meter for maximum effectiveness - who needs numbers, anyway? The Seeker has to prevent the Hider from collecting goo until it runs out of energy, or capture it once it has been sufficiently weakened.</li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Who are we?</h2><strong>Brave Little Studios</strong> is a group of 9 graduate students from the University of Utah's Entertainment Arts and Engineering program."

Playing and mastering each character offers fun and exciting experience for players.<br>     -	In collaboration with various FPS game development veterans, we’ve focused on the core experience of handling each and every weaponry ranging from assault rifles, SMG, shotguns and sniper rifles. As we believe one of the most important factors within a FPS game is weapon mechanics, we welcome you to join us on the battlefield.<br>    -	All Mercenaries gain unique skills through their “Special Suits”. Skills are categorized into Offensive/Defensive/Support types and also provide benefits to team mates. Such skills provide additional grounds for strategy that can grant you and your team victory on the battlefield.<br>    -	Metro Conflict: The Origin differs from generic FPS experience with the new EXD (Extreme Domination) game mode. EXD is a 6vs6 team play where two teams fight to gain control over a satellite hacking device known as the “Marker”. Once a team gains control of the “Marker”, they are able to choose their own location to set up and channel the device to fully activate it to win the round. It is important for a team to have great cohesion in order to have an edge over the other team. Strategy in terms of team build and map usage opens up a wide range of possible scenarios.<br><br><strong>Metro Conflict: The Origin seeks to value the following elements;</strong><br><br>   -	No Pay to Win: The game will strictly be based on individual skill, team work, and strategy.

No better customer satisfaction can be attained than to truly listen to the users. We will continue to focus on keeping our ears open to your feedbacks and improve your gameplay accordingly."

Battle mode of this game is traditional turn-based-RPG, of which party with higher speed makes the first move. Battle command involves attack, abilities, magic, props and flee.

And when defeated, game will not end, but rather trigger some unspeakable event (winky face with nothing but INNOCENT smile). <br />

class=""bb_tag"">游戏剧情</h2>	秦朝是中国历史上第一个中央集权专制王朝，它的创始人秦始皇嬴政，也是中国历史最伟大的君王之一，他统一了诸侯纷争的战国时代，建立秦帝国。他统一中国的度量衡和文字；他派人修建了著名的万里长城。但是他似乎做错了一件事情，把自己的大儿扶苏发配边疆，在历史上扶苏是被弟弟胡亥和赵高所陷害而死，但是在这个游戏中扶苏并没有死，他做为太子为了复仇而踏上的艰难的旅程。游戏主人公扶苏，本来继位的应该是他。父亲无故的死亡、弟弟无端的陷害、家人无辜的被杀、旧友无情的出卖、义士无私的帮助、爱人无微不致的关心。使扶苏在这个乱世力图报仇，力图有所作为。他可不可杀死陷害他的仇人呢？他可不可以力挽秦朝覆灭的狂澜呢？他可不可以与相爱的人永远生活在一起呢？他可不可以建立自己的国度使人民安居乐业呢？一切都靠玩家的努力！<br>你从没想过，自己堂堂的大秦太子，有一天会陷入千里亡命的境地。父皇的一纸诏书竟然要你自尽，任你挠破了头，也想不出这究竟原因何在？若非蒙恬老将军拼死掩护你逃出生天，恐怕你早已是地府的冤魂了。而此时的你心中只有一个念头：回到咸阳！<br>从上郡杀出重围，一路上秦兵围追堵截搜捕甚急，而你身上也早已是伤痕累累，血染甲袍。数天的亡命旅途让你的神经近乎于麻木，连伤口的疼痛似乎也已经感觉不到了。在赵村外，你遇到了常往军营送粮的农夫赵五夫妇，他向你指明了南去咸阳的道路，又见你衣甲鲜明太过引人注目，于是以自己的衣物相赠。你脱下血迹斑斑的盔甲，换上农夫装扮继续向南逃亡。然而就在你走后不久，秦兵追了上来，赵五隐瞒了你的行踪，不料却被秦兵发现了你的衣甲。 <br>	最后来说说游戏的名字。《秦殇(shang)》两字正是游戏的灵魂所在。“殇”字深奥，它有夭折；战死者，死在外面的人两种意思。这个古意十足的字，与游戏本身有着完美的契合度。游戏是从秦始皇死于沙丘开始，直至秦国覆灭为止。秦国作为中国历史上第一个统一的封建王朝，自建立到灭亡只有短短的15年，喻之为夭折，当不为过。而其间陈胜、吴广大泽乡起义反秦，后因内部勾心斗角也是最终夭折。最后楚霸王乌江自刎更是让人感慨英雄早逝。游戏通过主角眼睛看到的当时社会：凄凉悲切，殇者满目，客死他乡的劳工、黔首戍边的民夫、英勇不屈的义军、负隅顽抗的秦兵.似乎只有一个“殇”字才能够如此精练的体现。而扶苏在游戏中的命运，和“殇”更是牢牢的结合。<h2

class=""bb_tag"">游戏音乐</h2>游戏还有一个特色，是音乐非常有民族感。游戏的配器以民族音乐为主，但是不局限于现有的民族音乐。因为现有的民族音乐大多来自近代，而游戏要表现的是上古时期的社会。主要采用的民族乐器有：筝，箫，埙，笛，鼓。其它民族乐器适当的采用了，如琵琶，二胡等。游戏使用一个或者多个主旋律，在这个旋律之下，产生若干种变奏。根据游戏情节和气氛的需要，在节奏，曲调，配器等方面产生这些变奏。用以表达激昂的，愤怒的，悲伤的，浪漫的等各种情绪。主旋律用的是交响乐形式表现，也通过重奏或者独奏的形式表现，甚至使用了合唱或者独唱表现。<h2 class=""bb_tag"">多结局系统</h2>最终章<br>从阿房宫中杀出，你闯入赵高府邸寻找赵高。在府内你发现了一个地宫入口。冲破了层层阻碍，你终于在地宫三层找到了赵高。一场你期待已久的复仇决战开始了。这里要注意赵高有两次变身，也就是说要打败他三次才能彻底消灭他。而且每次变身后，赵高的属性都会增强。他法术攻击的威力尤其强大，有时甚至能一击致命，所以要随时注意他的准备动作，一旦发现他要释放强力法术，就要快速跑开，脱离他的法术范围。针对他经常瞬间转移的特性，用强力的远程攻击应该是个不错的方式。另外就是要准备大量的食物药材，随时注意补充生命值。当赵高终于倒在你的剑下，你的心中却并没有大仇得报的快感，只有着无尽的迷惘，你昂首向天，自己的归宿究竟在何方？<br>总结局<br>公元前221年，秦始皇剿平六国，终结了春秋五强争霸，战国七雄逐鹿数百年的纷争，建立了中华历史上第一个统一的王朝——大秦帝国！<br>公元前206年，楚人后裔项羽率领四十万义军攻入咸阳，一把大火将富丽无双的阿旁宫付之一炬，标志着显赫一时的大秦帝国土崩瓦解。<br>在阿房宫烧了三月之久的熊熊烈火中，赢秦列祖列宗历经百年为之前仆后继顽强搏击而创下的皇皇伟业，赫赫声威，伴随着那袅袅青烟黯然逝去，进入了任凭江上钓翁、里巷老妪随意戏说的历史。<br>短短十五载，大秦就像历史长空中划过的流星，在绽放了他耀眼光芒之后，便瞬息消失，无迹可寻。可留给我们的却是无尽的思考与慨叹……<br><br>1归隐桃源<br>手刃仇人的快感并没有在你心中停留多久，耳边隐隐传来的依然是疆场的铁蹄奔雷、百姓的哀鸣呻吟。赵高死了，但战争却并没有因此而结束。战乱的年代带给百姓们的永远是痛苦与伤害，和平才是他们永恒的期盼。而这一切不是杀死一个赵高就能实现的！<br>你最终回到了赵村边那个与世隔绝的世界，为战乱中需要生存渴求安定的百姓建设了一个真正的世外桃源。时光流逝，这个被你命名为“桃花之源”的地方一点点的兴盛起来，居民们安居乐业，其乐融融。你没有告诉他们你的名字，看着洋溢在他们眉宇间的欢乐，你觉得对你而言那已经足够了。<br>必要条件：完成找到桃花源的任务。<br><br>2归隐苗疆<br>既没有兴奋畅快，也没有心满意足，手刃仇敌后你只有一种感觉——如释重负。你将宝剑插在地上仰面向天，想从冥冥的空中找到父亲凝视你的双眼。刘邦的大军已抵城边，社稷已倾，大秦将亡，这不再是你的国家了，你唯有选择离开。<br>茵珠陪着你回到了云雾谷，你在这里开始了真正平静的生活，布衣取代了盔甲，宝剑换作了药锄，你觉得这种无欲无求或许才是真正适合你的归宿。<br>必要条件：茵珠必须在队伍中。<br><br>3归隐扶桑<br>报得大仇的你悄然离开了咸阳，重返泰山。令你吃惊的是，徐福似乎早已料到你会来，一支满载待发的船队在你的带领下，出海东渡，去寻求传说中缥缈虚幻的海外仙山。后世，当扶桑之名传入中原时，没<br>有人想得到这和你的名字是否有着些许微妙的关联。但这一切都不重要，当你登上那个人迹罕至的海岛，你的生命已经开始了新的序章。<br>必要条件：完成卢生事件，找到徐福。<br><br>4归隐塞外<br>默默地还剑入鞘，你觉得自己应该笑，可充塞胸臆的却是一种想哭的冲动。围绕金钱权力，手足可以相残，朋友拔刀反目。手握权杖的人只要一句话，千万人头就会落地。这不是你的世界，你只想离开。你来到北方，融入豪爽质朴的塞外民族，有时与匈奴新单于冒顿一起骑猎于茫茫草原，日子过得单纯简单却快乐。<br>冒顿为了感激你帮助他夺回王位，一直信守诺言，从不侵犯中原。可惜，刘邦统一全国之后，意欲大举攻打匈奴，胸怀雄才伟略的冒顿先是假意示弱，而后乘刘邦在白登山巡视不备之际，突起四十万精兵将其包围，千钧一发之际，借助你的帮忙，刘邦才免于一死。后世人一直对冒顿当时不杀刘邦感到困惑，那是因为他们不知道你的存在，历史就是这样，真正创造历史的人十之八九都没有留下他们的名字。<br>必要条件：帮助冒顿夺得单于之位。<br><br>5皈依墨门<br>你突然觉得自己好累，人为什么要自相残杀？为什么彼此间不能和睦相处？那么多的尔虞我诈，你死我活，为了一点权势连自己的亲兄弟都能出卖，为了一时之利，可以抛弃做人的尊严。如此种种，这些究竟都是为了什么？你记起墨钜方仲经常向自己提起的墨家“兼爱、非攻”的思想，想起旅途中和方仲多次的彻夜畅谈，突然觉得或许只有依照墨家的主张才能营造一个完美的世界。于是，你和方仲四处浪迹，一起为了理想中的世界而奋斗。<br>必要条件：方仲必须在队伍之中。<br><br>6携美归隐<br>都结束了。长久以来，你一直盼望着这一刻的到来，然后当这一刻真的到来的时候，你却突然觉得难以接受，从此以后，自己的存在还有什么意义？仇恨、背叛、奸谋、鲜血、死别……你突然觉得自己是如此孤独，自己已经一无所有！于是，你痛哭失声。一只温暖的手悄悄地放在你的肩头，你转过身，看着这些与自己一同出生入死的女子，她们与自己一样，经历了生离死别，经历了世间的风雨，她们默默地注视着你，是的，从此以后，你便是她们唯一的依靠，唯一的亲人。<br>春夏交替，年复一年，没有人知道扶苏究竟去了哪里。很多年以后，曾经有人在骊山看到一个中年男子在始皇陵前祭奠，他的身后还有几个女子和孩童……<br>必要条件：队伍中全是女性。<br><br>7辅佐刘邦<br>此时此刻，你的心中百感交集。父亲一统江山、君临天下时的霸王气概，儿时和兄弟姐妹一起嬉戏时的无忧无虑，与娇妻新婚燕尔时的柔情蜜意，戍守边关放马大漠时的豪情逸致……过往的一切在你眼前一一浮现。泪，悄然而下。这一切，仿佛在梦中，朦朦胧胧却又如此的清晰，梦醒之后，一切都变了。只有自己儿时便执著的抱负依旧不改——让天下百姓不再受兵戈之苦，不再受分离之痛，不再流离失所。但如今的大秦帝国已风雨飘摇、大势已去，即便自己重登皇位，又能如何？<br>力挽狂澜不如开天辟地！你想到了刘邦。是的，如今群雄四起，但只有刘邦才有君临天下的气概和谋略。项羽不过是有勇无谋的一介勇夫，治天下，非刘邦莫属。于是，你找到刘邦，与张良、韩信等人一起南征北战，终于一统天下。刘邦登基之日，你留信辞行，毅然归隐。信中，你叮嘱刘邦，对任何人都不要提起自己，任何时候都不要告诉别人秦太子扶苏曾助他称帝。从此以后，你只是一个普通的大汉子民，你的名字叫作子秦......<br><br>最普通结局，不需要达成任何条件。</strong>"

Instead you will rule from the shadows and compete with other factions for control points representing a region's military, economic, and political leadership. <br></li><li>Geopolitics is your sandbox – unite or break apart nations as best serves your ends, while using those under your influence to conduct proxy wars against the other six factions. Earth’s regions are modeled in detail, from educational levels and unrest to GDP and inequality. Gaining command over regions with great monetary wealth and military power can allow you to implement your will on Earth, but the war for the Solar System will not be won without also securing regions containing space launch facilities.<br></li><li>Enact your will through a council of politicians, scientists, and operatives sent around the world (and even into space).

This means your space stations and forward operating bases are constantly moving as well, forcing you to plan accordingly and adapt to the evolving circumstances – your colonies among the Jovian moons could find that a once-distant alien military outpost or Initiative privateering base has suddenly become a close neighbor.</li></ul><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176470/extras/headline_04.png?t=1744896942"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176470/extras/image_04_loop.gif?t=1744896942"" /><br><br>Terra Invicta explores what might be – how colonies on Mars might function, what plausible engines could power our spaceships, and the nature of how space colonization and warfare might proceed.

You can design your own ships, selecting from an array of weapons, drives, and other modules to place on a variety of hulls, ensuring each ship has the right mix of fuel capacity, maneuverability, and other capabilities.<br></li><li>Tactical combat is built around a realistic simulation of Newtonian physics, where momentum and maneuver in 3D space are just as important as the firepower your ships carry. Fire missiles and use point defense cannons to destroy incoming projectiles; build up momentum then swing hard to bring the enemy into your firing arcs; or grapple with the difficult decision to retract radiators and sacrifice heat dissipation to achieve better armor against an incoming enemy barrage.</li></ul><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1176470/extras/headline_05.png?t=1744896942"" /><br>Terra Invicta is built with modding support in mind, and much of the game is accessible to modders without a coding background.

On the European front, you will be taken to the shores of <strong>Anzio, Italy</strong>- working your way towards the bombed peaks of <strong>Monte Cassino</strong>. You will also be taken to <strong>Kos</strong>- the Greek island invaded by the Germans in 1943. In the Pacific, you will go to <strong>Kwajalein</strong>- the Japanese-occupied island invaded by the United States Marine Corps in 1944. Finally with the Africa campaign you will fight in the tropical biomes of Tunisia.

Also, battles don’t stop when a tank is disabled- lots of tank crews in World War 2 had time to escape from the scuttled tanks and survive the battles, and so do they in Easy Red 2.

A whole new vector-graphics engine gives the game a more adaptable, cleaner user interface, and the fourth in the series builds on the past while adding a host of new features such as media reports, coalition governments, emergency powers, three-party systems and a more sophisticated simulation that handles inflation, corruption and modern policy ideas such as quantitative easing, helicopter money, universal basic income and policies to cover current political topics such as police body cameras, transgender rights and tons more.<br><br>Democracy 4 is the ultimate sandbox for testing out your political ideas. We all think our politicians are useless and that we could do a better job ourselves, but is that really true? With one eye on the budget, one-eye on the polls, and somehow finding time to watch out for terrorist attacks at the same time, you will find that staying in power while changing society for the better is a tougher job than you ever imagined.<br><br>Would it really be a good idea to legalize all drugs? to give the police machineguns? to ban abortion? to invest heavily in green energy? would UBI really work? can you stay elected after cutting pensions in half to pay for your science budget?

This is a strategy game, not a political protest :D. If you want to turn your country into ayn rand's fantasy, abolish all public spending and all taxes, you can do that. it might work, it might not! depending on how you handle it. On the other hand if you want to nationalise the railways, the energy companies, the water companies, cap CEO pay, ban second-home ownership and put universal income in place, you can do that too. All the game tries to do is model the *likely* effects, short and long term of any action you take.<br><br>Because modders have so enthusiastically supported earlier games in the series, we are doing our best to make Democracy 4 as mod-friendly as possible too, and steam workshop support will make choosing and installing mods easy. Ultimately all our data is in text files that you can edit yourself, so if you think our analysis of the link between car tax and car usage is wrong (for example), its trivial to edit it, and share your changes with other players.<br><br>Ultimately Democracy 4 is not a game about simply winning an election, but about running the country. Losing an election is just  the end-game (unless you get assassinated), the real challenge to the game is whether or not you can create a country you are honestly proud of. I hope you enjoy trying :D"

What starts as an open-and-shut case of idiotic vandalism balloons into an all-out conspiracy as Sam and Max encounter one miscreant after another who have been mysteriously hypnotized. (You can tell from the &quot;spinny thing&quot; they do with their eyes.)<br><br><br>Who's the source of this malfeasance, and what is their dastardly plan? Cracking this case will require Sam's nose for detective work, Max's lack of conscience, an assortment of inventory items, and a little help from neighbors Sybil Pandemik, Bosco, and Jimmy Two-Teeth. From Sam &amp; Max's street to the White House lawn, inside the internet, and all the way to the moon, this baffling mystery gets weirder and funnier as it unfolds."

If you don't enjoy figuring things out or you don't know much about tanks, it may be worth holding off until better guidance is in place.</i><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Hull &amp; Turret Shape Design</strong></h2>Easy to use and flexible enough to give you endless design starting points. Drag on a face or edge to move it. Bigger compartments create more internal space but have more surface to armour. <br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674170/extras/HullShapingDemo2.gif?t=1632163787"" /><br>Well angled shapes may bounce incoming shells off entirely, leaving only a scratch and several ringing ears.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Armour Design</strong></h2>Set the thickness of each armour plate, allowing you to block shots from your foes. Though the weight and space used adds up!<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Cannon Design</strong></h2>Build a gun capable of piercing enemy armour. You'll need enough space and force to rotate it. Make sure you save enough room for ammo!<br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674170/extras/CannonDemo.gif?t=1632163787"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Crew Design</strong></h2>Humans are light but large and quite essential, squeeze them in and assign them one or more roles. Cramped and overworked crew perform poorly.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Attached Parts</strong></h2>Add functional and decorative parts to the exterior of your vehicle. These can define where internals are e.g. the engine is positioned where you place your exhausts and vents, then gets hit if a shell pierces your armour in that area. Place a fuel port in front of the driver and the fuel tank just might absorb a projectile, saving their life - if it doesn't ignite...<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Track Design</strong></h2>Focus your tracks and suspension on trench crossing, mountain climbing, going fast or just looking cool.<br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1674170/extras/TrackDesignDemo2.gif?t=1632163787"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Engine Design</strong></h2>Design anything from ship engines to lawnmower engines in a basic powerplant designer.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Fuel Tank Design</strong></h2>Set your fuel capacity and tank locations. Even bring them outside of the vehicle - if you don't mind them being shot off every now and then.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Transmission Design</strong></h2>Design your ratios - make it faster backwards than forwards or give it a 1st gear that can climb any mountain. One of these on each track will let one side drive while the other reverses, turning on the spot.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Internal Component Health</strong></h2>No hit-points. Vehicles carry on the fight as long as their critical internals are still functioning.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Full Powertrain Simulation</strong></h2>Engines, transmissions &amp; tracks work together to move your tank with a realistic simulation, making vehicles feel like the real thing.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Scenarios</h2>Battle in a range of environments with a team of your custom tanks, although make your design too expensive and you might be on your own.
