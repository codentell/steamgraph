Lost Planet 3 introduces Jim Peyton, a rig pilot who leaves Earth to take on a hazardous but lucrative contract on E.D.N. III. Working for Neo-Venus Construction (NEVEC) who are preparing the planet for colonisation, Jim joins his fellow pioneers at the Coronis base and begins surveying the uncharted terrain and obtaining samples of the planet’s energy supply – Thermal Energy.<br />

With NEVEC’s existing Thermal Energy reserve running low the fate of the Coronis mission depends on the natural source of the energy supply being located. Realising that this is a great opportunity for a huge pay-off and early ticket home to his family, Jim braves the risk of the treacherous environment and threat of the indigenous Akrid.<br />
Acting as a home away from home and boasting an array of tools that can assist Jim on the field, the utility rig provides Jim’s safety and is essential not only for his contract work but also his protection against the ever-changing climate.<br />

Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere, and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.<br />
<br />
KENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO is a magical realist adventure game in five acts, featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts, abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community."

This gives the multiplayer game more depth than ever before, as individual matches now matter for the overall victory or loss in the MP campaign. Both sides battle it out to control territories on a large scale battle map, voting on which territories to attack, whether to attempt to take more territory, or to defend and try to grind down the enemy's resources. We like to say it is like a “meta-game&quot; of Risk. This features both Stalingrad and Pacific Theater campaigns. <br></li><li>All new level: Betio. The tiny island of Betio was the scene of the heaviest fighting during the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943, the first major US amphibious offensive of the Pacific Theater. The map here recreates the push of the US 2nd Marine Division across the devastated island against their counterparts in the 6th Special Naval Landing Force (the Japanese 'Marines') as the US forces attempt to disable key tactical objectives such as naval guns and transmitter stations. The map favors desperate pitched defenses and assaults at all costs. <br></li><li>Two new weapons, one for Rising Storm and one for Red Orchestra 2. Red Orchestra 2 gets the PPS-42 submachine gun. Born out of desperation during the siege of Leningrad, the PPS-42 provides the Russians with a powerful, lightweight SMG option. For Rising Storm, the Japanese get the Type 97 sniper rifle. More accurate than the existing Type 99 sniper rifle, this weapon gives the Japanese another way to reach out and touch their enemies. <br></li><li>Classic Mode Refinements. While Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2 are considered by many to be one of the most hardcore shooters out there, the hardcore among the fan base have been clamoring for something even more extreme and authentic. The fans have asked and we've answered with further refinements to Classic Mode (the most hardcore gameplay mode in RS/RO2). We've made player movement changes, as well as aiming and recoil changes to make it more difficult to keep your aim on enemies resulting in longer and more intense firefights. </li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Previous Updates:</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Counterattack Map Contest Pack 1: 4 new maps!<br></li><li>Counterattack Map Contest Pack 2: 3 new maps!</li></ul></p><br><h1>Digital Deluxe Edition</h1><p><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/234510/extras/game_page_banner_tweaked.jpg"" /><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Day 1 Unlock of: the US M12 Trench shotgun, the Japanese Type 99 Machine Gun, the Japanese Type 99 Sniper Rifle with 4X scope (level 2), and the US M1 Garand with bayonet (Level 2).<br></li><li>2 Rising Storm soldier playable characters for Killing Floor. <br></li><li>Rising Storm and Red Orchestra 2 soundtracks.<br></li><li>Will include the Red Orchestra 2 Steam Digital Deluxe Edition Upgrade (4 day 1 unlock weapons, 2 playable RO2 KF characters, and 2 RO2 hats in TF2).</li></ul></p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>INCLUDES ALL RED ORCHESTRA 2 MULTIPLAYER CONTENT!</strong></h2><br>Rising Storm is the next game in the award-winning Red Orchestra franchise. You know the great gameplay, innovative features and realistic audio and graphics of RO2 - Rising Storm will take this to the Pacific Theater, adding even more features, new levels, new weapons and new factions. The game will allow the player to fight across iconic locations from the famous island-hopping campaigns in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, as the US Army and Marine Corps fight it out with the Imperial Japanese army and Special Naval Landing Forces. Players will experience beach assaults, jungle fighting, close quarters night fighting and more across Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima and Saipan, among other iconic battles. The player is able to take the part of either side – American or Japanese – battling it out online in multiplayer on up to 64-player servers.<br><br>Rising Storm also introduces an entirely new type of gameplay to the franchise - asymmetrical warfare. The American’s have the apparent advantage in firepower with their fast firing semi-automatic rifles, fully automatic weapons, and devastating flamethrower. The Japanese balance this out with gameplay elements that model their raw courage, ferocity, and cunning use of equipment. Their knee mortars allow them to rain indirect fire down on their enemies from anywhere in the map. Grenades can be planted and turned into booby-traps for unwary GIs. The Japanese put very high store on close-quarter combat, with a bayonet on almost every weapon – even machine guns and SMGs. Their banzai charge suppresses the enemy making it difficult for them to return fire and gives them an opportunity to close in to use bayonets and katanas on their opponents.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Key Features</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>	Large Scale Multiplayer Combat in The Pacific: Take part in the brutal fighting in the Pacific online with up to 64 players at a time.<br></li><li>	Iconic Battles:  Experience iconic battles such as Iwo Jima, Saipan, and Guadalcanal as the US military struggles to clear the Japanese from the islands in the Pacific.<br></li><li>	Asymmetrical Gameplay: Far from the mirrored gameplay seen in other shooters, both sides utilize historical weapon sets and each have unique gameplay capabilities. American firepower is matched by Japanese ferocity and guile with such features as banzai charges, booby-traps, the infamous “knee mortar” and more. This creates a unique gameplay experience that can’t be found anywhere else. <br></li><li>	WWII weaponry redefined – again: all of the weapon functionality you expect from the franchise returns - true to life ballistics, bullet penetration, breathing, adjustable sights, free aim, weapon bracing, and more, create WWII weaponry that has no equal. To that add over 20 new weapons including the devastating flamethrower and the portable “knee mortar”.<br></li><li>	Morale: Your soldier’s state of mind plays a bigger role than ever. Banzai charging Japanese soldiers can heavily suppress the Americans making it difficult to return fire and allowing the Japanese to close the distance.  The Americans can use their firepower advantage to suppress their enemies and gain the advantage!<br></li><li>	Bonus Content: All Red Orchestra 2 multiplayer content is included with Rising Storm as a free bonus. Fight in the Pacific, then fight on the Eastern Front at any time, all in the same game and same server browser.

The Mason can craft blocks, statues, and tools from stone, but to do it he'll need a mallet and chisel crafted by the carpenter.

Mount Your Friends is a physics based competitive climbing game where what you climb is each other. Players take turns climbing to the top of a tower of previous climbers (and a goat) working to become the new highest point before time runs out. If you run out of time before reaching the top, you're eliminated. It's simple to get into, but difficulty to master. Adept competitors can create massive towers by flinging themselves faster than simple climbing methods can attain. Of course, you may also end up just falling all the way down a tower if you miss!"

Constructed by an unmanned research vessel sent from Earth, the Lun Infinus station was designed to run simulations for a five year period, exploring possibilities of human colonization in the case that Earth became uninhabitable.","On a distant edge of an unknown planet, an abandoned structure sits in silence. Constructed by an unmanned research vessel sent from Earth, the Lun Infinus station was designed to run simulations for a five year period, exploring possibilities of human colonization in the case that Earth became uninhabitable. Developed during an age of ambition and wealth, the project was quickly abandoned when interest faded in the following years. <br><br>The last transmission from Earth occurred more than thirty years ago. The Lun Infinus station contained five sentient computers, Derelicts, built with certain levels of mobility in the case of emergency or need for relocation. Each of these Derelicts was to formulate their own plan for colonization based on thousands of hours of simulations. Given the amount of time that has passed however, the simulations have become very elaborate and bizarre. Meanwhile however, a mysterious computer virus has emerged. The virus of unknown origins has been slowly ravaging the Derelicts. Because of this, more and more CPU processing power has been needed for anti-virus measures, leaving less power for the simulations. Coffee is the last mobile resident of the station, a small service robot who spends his days keeping the station and the Derelicts operational as they perform their daily tasks. Since CPU power is slim, Coffee has been cutting corners to find ways around the virus. By using small subsystems and less vital CPU's scattered through the station in lesser devices, Coffee has designed a line of digital helpers, each simply called a D-Co, or &quot;Digital Counterpart&quot;, to assist him in fighting the virus and keeping the station operational. Eventually the virus gets the best of each D-Co, and Coffee tries to create an improved D-Co using a different CPU. The latest is D-Co 9, built using the code of a simple computer game. Coffee dedicates his own CPU to be used for the main simulations, putting D-Co in charge of moving his body throughout the station, taking care of the needs of the Derelicts, and fighting off virus attacks when they occur.<br><br>GAMEPLAY:<br>The Desolate Hope mixes several gameplay styles. On the station and in the simulations, the game is a platformer. You will shoot enemies, collect powerups and bits (money) and upgrade yourself and your virtual battlers. When you enter a mini-simulation (the old arcade style screens) then the game becomes an 8-bit overhead dungeon crawler. There you can farm money and gain options to customize your battle experiences. When you encounter a virus boss, the game shifts to a JRPG style battle where you must use the mouse to select from your various options to defeat your opponent. Almost everything outside of these battles is aimed at upgrading your abilities and increasing your stats for these fights, they are the real challenge of the game.<br><br>&quot;The Desolate Hope, isn't great just because of its stunning artwork, its gripping sci-fi story, and its coffee pot protagonist. It also packs a triple punch with three distinct gameplay types, each skillfully woven together. The side scrolling action has different platforming elements for each section, the overhead adventure distills fun elements of a classic Zelda (including walls you can walk through or destroy) and the turn-based, RPG-style boss battles are visually mesmerizing and tough.&quot; <strong></strong><br><br>&quot;From a gameplay point of view The Desolate Hope mixes platforming with overhead adventure segments and semi turn-based battles. This is already intriguing, but I'm more impressed by its stunning visual style.&quot; <strong></strong><br><br>&quot;The Desolate Hope is developed by Scott Games and upon booting it up, you will notice the great artwork the game uses. It combines three gameplay genres, side scrolling, overhead adventure and a turn-based RPG styled battles. It might sound like a messy mash up but the game is able to pull it off without a hitch and gamers are in for a unique experience. Offering hours of gameplay, a unique leveling system and a day-and-night cycle.&quot; <strong></strong><br><br>&quot;The Desolate Hope constantly plays with the very idea of playing a video game. Unlike many modern games, it is hyper-aware of its gameness. There are games inside of games, simulations inside of simulations, mini-games inside of boss fights. And the fact that you’re playing as an AI that developed from a computer game is a very hard wink at the exhaustive level of metagaming that’s going on.&quot; <strong></strong><br><br>&quot;There are plenty of hours of gameplay, a nonlinear path allowing for exploration, and detailed art design. Now you can't beat that...&quot;<br><strong></strong><br><br>&quot;I very much enjoy a lot about this game; it’s takes on platforming, dungeon-crawling, and RPGs is unique and well mixed together so that one type of play benefits the other. It also has some incredible visuals, with very detailed character designs and a classic cyberpunk attitude, but not also without a bit of whimsy as well (one derelict has given up on his mission, becoming a toymaker and has begun recreating his simulation with child-like automatons).&quot; <strong></strong><br><br>&quot;So after encountering this on Rock Paper Shotgun, I was ready to declare my indie game of the year. Because any game made rock solid out of derelict, insane robots just makes my not-so-inner geek squeal. How insane are the robots? Each is actively running a matrix like test bed, and.... Well, one was building a mining simulator, decided that was too depressing, and started making toys. Another is trying to capture the artistic essence of the soul, but cant seem to make anything run for more than five seconds. The next is attempting to rebuild humanity out of two tissue samples. Then there's the one still running straight, he seems curiously nice... And the last one's dead and frozen. But still drawing power...Then there's the coffee pot. Which is you. Sort of. And hey, bonus! You've got fifteen days to live, and you're the ninth attempt at straightening things out. Good luck!&quot; <strong>-an enthusiastic fan</strong>"

There are different economic strategy games and they can be broken down to subtypes but from our viewpoint Caesar encompasses planning, constructing, diplomacy and military campaigns.","CaesarIA is inspired by an old-school economic strategy game, Caesar III which is a masterpiece among the games of this genre in our opinion. There are different economic strategy games and they can be broken down to subtypes but from our viewpoint Caesar encompasses planning, constructing, diplomacy and military campaigns.<br><br><strong>Economy and Trade</strong><br><br>Miniature model of an economy leaves the ruler no room for mistakes, under his leadership there are extractive industry (mines, sawmills, outcrop mines and farms) and production (factories, armories, wineries and brandy kitchens). And if some resource is scarce or not available, then trade with the neighbors can be a solution for the difficult situation. Mini-economy is complicated and takes into account a variety of facts: taxes, import/export, population of the town, healthcare, unemployment. In order to stay in the black it is necessary to develop houses with high income level but that can lead to a rise in unemployment which consequently results in big problems such as an embezzlement of municipal purse. <br><br><strong>Construction</strong><br><br>Construction is defined by the needs of the town, healthcare, procurement, buildings security provision. The main idea of construction is bringing workers to the area, there actors entertain the public, engineer provides service for shabby houses, vigils fight criminals.  Moreover, city folk prefer to occupy quiet picturesque location such as gardens farther from dirty barns and noisy barracks.<br><br><strong>Diplomacy</strong> <br><br>The emperor will not leave the town alone, Caesar himself will demand goods for his personal use, sometimes in huge amounts and with bad timing. If the player has enough nerve he/she can just turn a blind eye to Caesar which unfortunately results in game over. Therefore, it is important to stay friends with Caesar and send him presents such as modest donations or exotic animals. Towns in the neighborhood will also take part in common trade network of the Empire and compete in the deals with the town. <br><br><strong>Religion</strong><br><br>Romans were superstitions people and created the whole hierarchy of gods. 5 gods are in the game: <br>- Earth goddess, Ceres, when worshiped in the right way doubles the yield capacity. <br>- Restive Neptune can help the merchants have a successful voyage. <br>- Sly Mercurius can fill all barns and storage houses up to the roof. <br>- Spirit of Mars protects the town from foes brave enough to attack the town. <br>- Venus can brighten up the mood of city folk for a long time. <br><br><strong>Attitude of the City Folk</strong><br><br>The attitude of the city folk to you will be very important, if the reputation of the ruler is bad it can start the emigration, then criminal rate increases - riots, fires and many other problems occur. Therefore, it is necessary to take care of the people and analyse current deficiency. Healthcare is provided by hospitals and bath houses. Entertainment is fence play and chariot-riding. Food comes from farms and the sea. Religion and security are at control of the regular army. <br><br><strong>Military Set-up</strong><br><br>The city has to be protected from invasions of barbarians, the creation of bastille lies ahead, soldiers and barracks can be situated there as well as recruit depot. However, this is a way to recruit only varmint velites and reckless equites. Roman army is its legionnaires and they are heavily armored with helmets and shields that means a demand for ore and iron which are not so easy to excavate. But even if you have 2 cohorts of legionnaires nobody is free of fear therefore there is a need in a military academy where soldiers can have additional training in survival and ethics. <br><br><strong>Specific Features:</strong><br>+ Upload of the map from the original Caesar III game;<br>+ Construction\demolition of buildings and edifices;<br>+ Migration of population;<br>+ Farming and product distribution; <br>+ Entertainment, healthcare, religion, education;<br>+ Empire trade network with computer towns;<br>+ Extraction of raw materials and manufacturing;<br>+ Prefects, engineers, apprentices, soldiers, etc.;<br>+ Advisers;<br>+ Dynamic town modeling;<br>+ Changing the level of the houses according to the environment; <br>+ Healthcare and water facilities;<br>+ Military buildings.<br><br><strong>Future Plans</strong><br>- Real-life financial system (salary, goods purchase, hiring);<br>- Specialization of city folk, setting up personal relations and families;<br>- Class system in the town (slaves, plebs, clients and patricians);<br>- Various climate conditions;<br>- Map editor;<br>- Computer towns and empires modeling;<br>- Network play."

The captured player's inventory is accessible for the captor to search them.<br> <br>Additionally, a rope will be attached to a prisoner which will allow them to be pulled in any direction their captor wishes. In order to avoid severe grieving situations, players can hide a sharp stone or lock pick in their orifice. This &quot;hidden&quot; item can help them escape capture or commit suicide.<br><br><strong>PUNISHMENT &amp; DEATH</strong><br><br>Punishment &amp; Death Once the player has control of a captive, there are several options available for managing a prisoner.  Options range from simply locking them in a cage or dungeon, public humiliation in the pillory, or simply executing them.<br><br><strong>THE ANCIENT THRONE</strong><br><br>The Ancient Throne can be claimed by any player. Holding the Ancient Throne will grant its owner dominion over the entire map (change name of realm) and taxation rights over every other player.  The King of the Ancient Throne will receive the ability to collect the resource tax from every player within the game by visiting the Ravens Treasure Tree. The ravens automatically collect taxes in the game (behind the scenes of course, sneaky little things), and place them in the chests in their Treasure Tree. <br> <br>In addition, the King of the Ancient Throne will have access to the Ancient Sword and the Ancient Crown. <br><br><strong>PRODUCTION &amp; REFINING STATIONS</strong><br><br>Players will have the ability to collect resources and to craft them into useful items or building materials. Additionally, the progression mechanic for being able to craft higher valued items will be reliant on upgrading production stations to a higher level.  (Need a better quality sword?  Upgrade your anvil.)  Production and refining stations can craft or refine items as long as there are resources available unless ordered to do otherwise.  This allows the player the freedom to do other things while his kingdom remains productive. <br><br><strong>COLLECTION STATIONS</strong><br><br>Collection stations can be placed for grain and water. Collection stations will passively produce raw materials given they have enough fuel.<br><br>These collection stations will be fully interactive and if left un-defended will offer a nice target for unscrupulous or enemy players.  With this in mind, the player will want to protect their resources.<br> <br><strong>SIEGE EQUIPMENT AND RAIDING BASES</strong><br><br>Once the players build stone walls and iron doors, players will not be able to simply bash their way inside. Players will now need to employ one of many different techniques for entry.<br><br>The ranged option is to build trebuchets and launch large stones from afar at your opponent's castle. Players must place a counterweight to offset their projectile weight in order to get the range and destruction power they need from the stone they are launching. Players may also rotate the trebuchet. This alignment takes some practice but is very rewarding when set correctly.<br><br>Players may choose to go a more stealthy route by crafting lock picks. Lock picks, however, are very hard to craft, and do not work on iron doors and iron gates.<br><br>Players defending a base may employ their own trebuchet or set up a ballista which is great for killing other players at range.<br><br><strong>FIRST PERSON COMBAT</strong><br> <br>Our combat systems allow melee and ranged combat to take center stage when war breaks out. Inspired by games like Chivalry, Reign of Kings' combat system is being tuned for satisfying, fast paced action. Players fight over the scarce resources and face off to defend or capture the throne.<br><br><strong>MELEE</strong><br> <br>Players equip brutal weapons and use mouse buttons in an attempt to chop, slice, &amp; stab through an opponent. Players will want to upgrade their weaponry to inflict the highest amount of damage as melee combat will always be dangerous and unpredictable.  Armor will be highly prized in Melee as it will keep you in a fight much longer.<br> <br>We support delimbing and decapitation of an opponent to represent the visceral and brutal experience of medieval close-quarters warfare.  A variety of period realistic weapons and armor will be available for the player to craft as they progress toward elder content.<br><br><strong>RANGED</strong><br><br>Ranged fighting in ROK will encompass the use of the bow, crossbow, javelin, and throwing stones. A good way for a player to stay alive in a fight during the early game will be to use ranged weaponry and speed.  Keeping out of sword range from a marauding knight is always a good idea, but even more so if you’re not equipped with the quality of armor that can absorb a hit or two.<br> <br>A simple bow and spear may be capable of taking down wild game, but may not provide enough piercing power to get through the finest plate male.  It’ll be important for the player to learn what kinds of weaponry are most effective in a fight as it will be critical knowledge to stay alive and have impact in a fight.  Higher tier Steel-pointed javelins will be able to pierce some armors, but the crossbow is the best option for punching a hole through the most heavily plated opponent at range. <br> <br>The general rules of ranged weaponry will apply in ROK to determine functionality.  The bow will have the highest accuracy and reload speed, the crossbow will have greatest piercing power but is slow to reload, and thrown weapons will have the highest damage output, but are for short range use only.<br><br><strong>LOOT</strong><br><br>ROK features a plague-ridden village that was cursed and abandoned by the old gods. This village features plague-ridden villagers, loot crates, and some high-end loot drops. It is dangerous to be in the village for long periods of time due to the disease that will damage the player's health.<br><br><strong>DEATH</strong><br><br>ROK uses a roguelike death model similar to Rust.  When players die, they will fall to the ground as a ragdoll container that can be looted by other players.  Dead players will be provided with a random re-spawn option that can be improved through bed placement.<br><br><strong>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION</strong><br><br>Players begin the game by creating a unique character.  They will be able to refine their look in great detail by editing their body parts, choosing hair, and establishing a banner scheme to help them identify loyal friends during gameplay. You can also choose the voice style of your player's taunts.<br><br><strong>BUILDING</strong><br><br>Using the standard block, ramp and stairs, ROK building materials will consist of sticks, thatch, clay, wood, re-enforced wood, and stone.  Thatch, sticks, wood and clay will be widely available and often the first choice in material for beginning level housing. While these materials will offer shelter from poorly equipped enemies, they are easily breached by other players. Stone will offer much greater resistance to basic attacks and will only be damageable with siege tactics.  Players will be able to build their homes, towers and castles any way they like, but will need a great deal of space during elder content play in order to hold a large number of production, refining, and collection stations.<br> <br>Building castles will be a natural occurrence for players who reach elder content gameplay.  With the large number of production stations, refining stations, collection stations, chests, torture devices and respawn beds available for the player to build, comes the need to protect a large footprint of space."

Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market – and more!<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in <u>multiplayer</u> or in <u>single-player</u> mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both <u>custom</u> and <u>ranked</u> sessions (with matchmaking by rating).<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?</strong></h2><br>Yes, you can! In addition to <u>custom sessions</u> (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected <u>private sessions</u> (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers <u>team mode</u> (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in <u>spectator mode</u>, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?</strong></h2><br>Certainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: <u><strong>Gremlins, Inc.</strong></u> – the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and <u><strong>Gremlins vs Automatons</strong></u> – the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?</strong></h2><br>The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic <u>SAVE / LOAD</u> function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?</strong></h2><br>There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both <u>short-term</u> and <u>long-term</u> strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/369990/extras/StorePage07.png?t=1741686062"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES</strong></h2><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>This is an intense <u>strategy game</u>: make decisions at every round!

No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.<br><br>More than anything in life, gremlins value <strong>money</strong>, <strong>political power</strong> and <strong>prestige</strong>: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)</strong></h2><br>We felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>OUR DLC POLICY</strong></h2><br>We released Gremlins, Inc. on Steam in Early Access at the end of 2015. Since then, we released over 100 game updates as we continue to add more content and more features as well as improve the overall player experience.<br><br>This is what we typically add to the game with the regular free updates of the game:<br><br>* new features and new mechanics<br>* new cards and new Misfortunes<br>* new music tracks and new game themes (for special occasions such as Lunar New Year)<br><br>These seasonal updates are available to every owner of the game for FREE, regardless of DLC ownership.<br><br>And this is what we release as paid DLC:<br><br>* new character portraits and player tokens<br>* new music tracks and new game themes<br>* new trails, frames and emoticons<br>* new single-player content<br><br>If you enjoy Gremlins, Inc., you can support our development efforts by purchasing its DLC. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the extra content in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>STEAM COMMUNITY MARKET, CRAFTING AND ITEM STORE</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. features <u>in-game items</u> and fully supports <u>Steam Community Market</u>. While playing the game, certain actions will trigger random chest drops with items of varying rarity: it could be a new emoticon, a new profile background, a new music track, or one of the dozens of other cosmetic items. These items are FREE, yours to use or trade on <u>Steam Community Market</u>. We, the developer, do not engage in the direct sales of any drop items; only players can trade them.<br><br>The game also supports <u>crafting</u>: once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own <u>Steam Item Store</u> where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics).<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore21.png?t=1741686062"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>ONLINE &amp; OFFLINE VERSIONS</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player – we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, <strong><u>Gremlins, Inc.</u></strong>, features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times – in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, <strong><u>Gremlins vs Automatons</u></strong>, features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline."

Develop your club, earn experience in turn-based matches, learn new skills, achieve new classes, upgrade your facilities, buy and sell footballers, grow your youth academy, make difficult choices. It's a deep strategy game that respects your time.","<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Why choose Football, Tactics &amp; Glory when there are other football managers?</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">If you’ve played traditional football managers, you’re probably familiar with the following feelings:</p><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><strong>Complex attributes</strong>: Footballers have many attributes, and you don’t always understand which ones truly affect the match outcome. Often, the only strategy becomes buying high-level players instead of finding a footballer whose unique attribute perfectly suits your tactics.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><strong>Unclear results</strong>: You never really know why you win or lose. This forces players to search for &quot;winning&quot; formations on forums instead of analysing the opponent and consciously selecting footballers capable of exploiting their weaknesses.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><strong>Financial complexity</strong>: Club funds quickly disappear, and it’s hard to understand how to manage finances and strategically plan expenditures.</p></li></ul><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Football, Tactics &amp; Glory is a <u>game about full control</u> and a complete understanding of what’s happening on the pitch and in the club:</p><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Transparency of attributes</u>: You always know exactly how each footballer’s attribute impacts the encounters, allowing you to customise formations for each opponent, defeating even stronger teams with the right player selection and tactical approach. This also makes transfers much more interesting and exciting.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Control over tactics</u>: Feel like a real coach, making smart tactical decisions, not just changing formations hoping for luck.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Control over luck</u>: Luck plays a big role, as in real football. But you can minimise its impact by understanding your players’ abilities and building the team around your playstyle.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Strategic financial planning</u>: The game’s economy is designed so that you always feel in control of your finances. The game demonstrates the importance of strategies like &quot;developing&quot; footballers for sale and finding promising talents who will become your future stars.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>No micromanagement</u>: This is a game about <u>strategic planning</u>, not micromanagement. Instead of wasting time on increasing an attribute by 0.01%, you make decisions that significantly affect the club’s fate. Therefore, the game lacks the boring elements of football managers: endless spreadsheets, routine tasks, and unimportant mechanics.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Great variety</u>: FTG is so deep that even after hundreds of hours, you’ll continue discovering new and interesting things. The game world develops uniquely each time, creating new challenges and exciting emergent stories. This makes each campaign different from the last one.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>The game values your time</u>: You can complete one football season in a few real hours instead of days, as in other football managers. At the same time, each season is packed with events and interesting decisions.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Comprehensive tutorial</u>: The game explains all elements in detail. And if you still have questions, the active community will answer them on the forum or Discord. </p></li></ul><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Why does a football manager need a turn-based match mechanic?</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Good turn-based mechanics allow <u>complex systems to be simplified</u>, while retaining their essence and emotions. For example, XCOM perfectly conveys the feel of firefights with aliens, and Civilization — the development of a civilisation.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Our turn-based system uses key football concepts to make match outcomes and your tactical decisions clear and transparent. Once you understand how these mechanics work, you’ll feel the emotions inherent in real football.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""> </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Additionally, the ability to take your time with each move allows for comfortable gameplay. Especially if you’re over 40 and don’t have the reaction speed you once had.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">So, is it a full-fledged football manager?</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph""> Yes, it’s a serious football manager that’s easy to start playing due to its apparent simplicity, but hard to stop because of the depth of its features.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Game features:</h2><ul class=""bb_ul""><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Take your club to the top</u>: Start in the lower league and lead your club to the heights of world football. Or choose any club in the Premier League or another league of your choice.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Create your own leagues and clubs</u>: With the built-in editor, you can create real clubs and leagues.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Use modifications</u>: Take advantage of numerous mods created by the player community.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Dynamic game world</u>: Other clubs buy and sell players, train them, and develop youth — the game world lives and evolves with you.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Promotion and relegation system</u>: Each country has a Premier League and several lower leagues. Teams are promoted or relegated between leagues depending on their final position. Top teams from different countries participate in continental tournaments similar to the Champions League and Europa League.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Club development</u>: Improve infrastructure, hire coaches, and develop your Youth Academy.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Unique players</u>: A powerful face generation system makes each footballer unique. The face editor is also available for you.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Online matches</u>: Play a friendly match with a friend online.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Co-op play</u>: Create a tournament and play a season with friends on one computer (or online via Remote Play Together). Up to 32 people can participate in the tournament.</p></li><li><p class=""bb_paragraph""><u>Twitch integration</u>: Viewers can interact with the game via chat.</p></li></ul>"

You are the X-Morph - an alien species that invades Earth to harvest its resources and terraform the surface. Strategize in the build mode by carefully selecting various types of alien towers or throw yourself right into the heat of the battle. Build mazes for incoming enemies in an environment that provides exceptional planning freedom. Tear down buildings and collapse bridges to support your defense or to simply indulge in a spectacle of unprecedented destruction. Possess a range of unique alien weapons and use defense strategies like you've never seen before in this genre.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/408410/extras/tower_defense_header.png?t=1742823094"" /></h2><h2 class=""bb_tag""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_maze_600x338.png?t=1742823094"" /></h2><br>Your goal is to defend the X-Morph harvesters from waves of incoming human forces. Each enemy wave is preceded by a setup phase in which the player can check what types of enemies are going to be attacking him and to observe their paths. There is no time limit for this phase, so the player can carefully plan his defenses or choose to start fighting immediately and place towers when needed during the battle. One of the game's key features is the ability to build towers virtually anywhere on the map and to shape enemy paths by connecting towers with laser fences. The player can choose between building long mazes out of basic towers or placing more advanced towers which are more effective at different types of incoming enemies. Advanced tower types specialize in dealing with specific enemy types e.g. flame towers are great for destroying fast moving ground units, artillery towers are best at countering large groups of slow enemies, anti-air laser is ideal for shooting down heavy bombers.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_shooter_600x338.png?t=1742823094"" /></h2><br>As the X-Morph fighter you can engage enemy units directly with a diverse arsenal of weapons. You can morph into four distinct forms which specialize in dealing with different kinds of threats. Each form has a basic attack and a special charged attack mode. The Plasma Fighter is the most universal form - good at destroying both air and ground units. The Dark Matter Bomber is great at decimating groups of ground units. It can also slow down time and release a dark matter bomb that can cut down buildings. The Shredder fighter is perfect for annihilating large numbers of human air units and clearing the sky. Finally, the Laser Destroyer is best for smelting large single units. It can also charge up a gravitational anomaly that sucks in smaller enemy units.  A large variety of weapons and enemies along with a dynamic, fully destructible environment provides a rich arcade shooter experience.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/408410/extras/enviro_header.png?t=1742823094"" /></h2><h2 class=""bb_tag""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_destruction2_600x338.png?t=1742823094"" /></h2><br>The game's environments are constructed with a lot of attention to detail and they are almost completely destructible. From small picket fences to huge skyscrapers. Any bridge or building in the game can be collapsed and it's destruction is dynamically simulated using realistic physics. The destruction is not only a visual effect as it can significantly influence the layout of the battlefield. The combination of dynamic environments, laser fences and real-time calculated enemy paths creates unique gameplay scenarios.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/408410/extras/mecha_header.png?t=1742823094"" /></h2><h2 class=""bb_tag""><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/408410/extras/xmorph_mech_600x338.png?t=1742823094"" /></h2><br>Humans are desperate to defend their homeworld.

Nightfall has come and the last of the workers are rushing back underground, dodging beetles to deliver food to the nest. The stockpile is empty, and without more, reinforcements will not hatch for the ongoing war between the duelling Empires of the Undergrowth.<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Starting from a central room hosting your queen, order your workers to develop and optimise your nest – a vast network of store rooms, nurseries, and hallways. Dig through a hex-based maze of soil and bedrock, seeking food and fending off other underground dwellers.<br></li><li>Push beyond the confines of your nest to see what the world above has to offer – with seeds, nectar, fungus, other insects, and even amphibians on the menu, there's plenty to choose from, but each food source comes with its own strategic tradeoffs and challenges. Will you venture forth and fight off the ladybugs that eat and deplete your source of renewable honeydew drops, or do the surrounding nocturnal creatures present too much of a risk for your fledgling colony? Each decision you make has a ripple effect that can doom your colony if you aren’t quick to react to evolving circumstances.<br></li><li>Manage a multitude of species with different attack patterns, natural weapons, and evolutionary paths to tackle the particular dangers of your current biome. Nighttime sorties are at times essential as you look to secure food supplies, though unsuspecting ants might fall prey to the dangers that lurk after sundown. Come morning, you’ll find yourself competing with other ant colonies instead, entering enemy nests to attack their queens while defending your own.

Few have returned, but they carry valuable sources of food that will help reinforce the front as a new wave of warriors pour forth from the nurseries, eagerly following the scent of pheromones that tell them where to go and what to do en route. They are the last bastion of the colony, born with a singular purpose – hold the line!<br><br><ul class=""bb_ul""><li>Design and organise multiple nurseries and assign them individual pheromone groups, with each pheromone group taking orders through the placement of pheromone markers, adjustable rules of engagement, and context. Learning to navigate the behaviours of your ants, as well as each species’ strengths and weaknesses, is integral to securing success.<br></li><li>Each pheromone group can be specialised on the fly, told to exclusively collect food, partake in combat, or do both – the right decision can turn the tide of battle. In desperate times, when the colony is starving and new eggs have stopped hatching as a result, will your warrior caste focus on gathering food at the risk of being picked off by aggressive enemies en route? Or will the soldiers divide into escort groups for your remaining workers, ensuring survivability at the cost of overall efficiency elsewhere? Don’t forget to keep at least some workers at the nest to dig, build, and maintain the placement of eggs, to ensure the survival of your ant economy.<br></li><li>Each species of ant presents its own set of strengths and weaknesses on the battlefield. In special game modes where multiple species can be raised in the same colony, your decision to raise and upgrade one or the other will completely change the way you do battle. Trap-jaw ants fight in melee, occasionally leaping back to replenish lost hitpoints. Leafcutter majors fulfil their natural role as protectors by drawing enemy aggression onto themselves to give allied ants an opportunity to flank, regroup, or escape. Wood ants can evolve to fire formic acid as long range artillery or in a more rapid, straight line. Find synergies between the multitude of natural strengths and weaknesses of each species, and prepare to defend against them when warring with rival colonies.<br></li><li>Your enemies are equally varied – apart from other ant colonies, you’ll engage in combat against arachnids, amphibians, crustaceans, and a wide variety of insect species. These powerful and often (comparatively) gigantic creatures present a unique threat to an unprepared colony, and only superior tactics can overcome them. An envelopment manoeuvre can circumvent the adult devil’s coach horse beetle's stunning spray, while tactically isolating and overwhelming hermit crabs one by one will bring their demise faster than they can hunker down to heal.</li></ul><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/463530/extras/headline_03.png?t=1744896342"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/463530/extras/image_03_loop.gif?t=1744896342"" /><br><br>Victory is certain!

The floating system and driving models are based on physics: each turn, slope, hard braking, acceleration, each turn and twist of the track will apply a unique force to the ship. A sharp low-polygon style blends meshes and terrains with the latest state-of-the-art shading and lighting effects provided by the <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>, creating beautiful and instantly recognisable aesthetics.

Every unit counts as the battle presses on, and raw firepower alone will not be enough to claim victory.

Legends state that whoever possessed the artifact would be granted divine wisdom and eternal life. Scolars even claim that without it, the Aztec Empire would have never came to flourish. <br />
While most academics considered it to be a myth, a world famous archeologist Tomb Jack recognized there could be some authenticity to the story. After years of research, shrouded in secrecy, he led an expedition to prove the artifact's existance and bring it back to the civilized world. He was able to discover an ancient crypt which led him and his companions to a place none of them could have imagined, even in their wildest dreams. Unfortunately, after many months, none of them returned and soon, all were proclaimed dead. <br />
Years later, Tomb Joe, renowned archelogist and a fearless adventurer recieved a mysterious letter adressed to his long lost father. It only contained two things - an ancient map and a golden medallion engraved with the symbol of the Sceptre. While the medallion piqued his interest, it was the map that made him act. For the first time, he learned the destination of his father's expedition. There was no time to waste. Not an hour later, Joe was already on his way to Central America... <br />

She usually has worries in her mind, and doesnât speak often. Therefore, her classmates believe that she is unpredictable. As a born beauty, she is busty. She could have become a popular beauty in the school. However, she is not so popular, because she is not good at social contact. She only has some fans who admire her secretly. She is able to peacefully accept things unacceptable to ordinary people, which probably results from her fatherâs job, a war photographer. She often followed her father to many places when she was very young, and also encountered dangerous situations. Therefore, she has excellent physical fitness, which is enough for her when she deals with hooligans. She is somewhat insensitive, so itâs hard for her to understand how others feel. A neighbor, who is a childhood partner of her, often comes to her house to have dinner with her, but she has never perceived the boyâs admiration for her."

Ghost Xi’E is evil in its nature yet not powerful and unable to perform killing, yet it is a demon who wishes everyone to be evil. It uses the greed in people and lures them to the gamble to perform this cruel soul-gambling game after game.<br>Ghost Xi’E uses its unique power to build dreams, turning the gambling game into a small illusion, luring the participants in it. For those who are inside this illusion, this gambling game is nothing but a real killing game. They will be hunted by devils during the escape, and Ghost Xi’E would conjure many cardholders to allow people to expel those devils who are also the poor souls that are imprisoned by Ghost Xi’E.<br>Cheated by Ghost Xi’E, gamblers join the game one by one, which keeps the game alive. However, no one will actually win except for the Ghost.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>An Unfair Competition</strong></h2>Without exceptions, all the gamblers put their souls at stake. They are dragged into the illusion in groups of four. What they are facing is only one devil, who seems to be outnumbered, yet the gamblers are relatively weaker under the threats of the devil. All they can do is to collect cards, break the seal and expel the devil. However, the items that they redeemed from Ghost Xi’E only add small chances to survival.<br>Ghost Xi’E’s tricks also haunt the devil so that it can never directly catch the preys in order to rouse the killing thirst inside them.

However, no matter who they are and what their purposes are, in the eyes of Ghost Xi’E, they are nothing but souls and something to play with.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>The Cruel and Wronged Devils</strong></h2>Ghost Xi’E gathered countless wronged spirits and transformed them into cruel devils. With the power of resentment, each devil possesses a unique and despairing power.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Charming Oriental Scenes</strong></h2>Ghost Xi’E builds illusions one by one based on the real world so that they are too real for one to see the truth. A plagued abandoned train station where heavy bangs and cracking can be heard in the wind. A hundred years old palace that used to be so flourishing is now deserted, terrible sighing can be heard during midnight. A far away Hakka Tulou that was cursed due to a terrible ghost wedding has lost its peace. In these half real and half unreal scenes, gamblers have gradually forgotten the real world.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>The Stake-redeemed Items</strong></h2>In every gamble, the gamblers can obtain stakes via sealing the cardholders while the devil via catching and killing gamblers. This senseless stakes gave both parties the hopes to win and rouse their greed. The stakes can be redeemed for all kinds of surviving and hunting items from Ghost Xi’E. Beneath these hopes are nothing but the tricks of the demon who only wants to feed on people’s essence and energy.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>The Game of Souls</strong></h2>In countless gambles, the gamblers and the devils continually explore and learn from each other. As a gambler, one must decide whether to focus on the cardholders or helping the injured teammates, or escape by items or depending only on themselves.

The Steel and Statecraft update builds on some existing mechanics and also address some player feedback from the last update.<br>Among other things, the update implements a new Political Difficulty option. We understand that some players like to challenge themselves with political manoeuvring, while others prefer to stay away from such back-stabbing. You can now tweak this area of the game separately from Campaign Difficulty. The politics system is also undergoing some other changes, particularly in the events that come about as the result of political actions.<br>Here are some more highlights of the changes that have been made.<br><br><strong>Estates Overhaul</strong><br>The purpose of Estates was to add challenges in managing a kingdom where each noble is playing the game of intrigue, looking to grab more power and land for themselves. However, the system didn’t have as much impact as we’d have liked, which is why Estates have received a rework to better represent a king granting land to his more important lords, thus ensuring their devotion to the crown. With the power of land ownership comes a responsibility for the owner to properly tend to his holdings – each Estate will offer a positive effect if given to the proper lord, or a negative one if the noble is not suited to presiding over such lands. <br>The nobles in turn do not sit idly, hoping for deeds to fall in their lap. The Estate Desire traits, which characters previously gained, have been replaced with requests, directed towards the crown in the form of missions. Every so often a lord in your faction will ask to be granted Estates, offering a reward in return. But if you deem the noble ineligible or sense malicious intent, and you ignore their request, their loyalty will start to waiver.<br>We’ve added more weight to managing your Estates, and to help with that we’ve reorganized the Estates interface. Each lord will list the effects that they provide from Estates they own. Moving Estates around has been made easier – clicking on an Estate will grant it to the selected character on the left. Beware, however, of dealing with Estates that are not in the king’s possession – nobles are quite attached to their lands and will rarely part with them without repercussions.<br><br><strong>Traits</strong> <br>Traits depict the story of each character; their upbringing, their personality and the events that have occurred in their lifetime. Sifting through each character’s history can be cumbersome, which is why we’ve stacked traits into groups. Each trait group is now represented by a banner, with all effects of the traits within listed underneath. Clicking on a banner will list all traits within that group, giving a detailed account of the noble’s qualities. <br>As mentioned previously, each trait group will list how it affects a character’s Estates. The group with the most traits will be marked with a large yellow icon, showing the lord’s dominant characteristics and what effects they grant to the noble’s land ownership.<br><br><strong>Recruitment Revamp</strong><br>Recruitment in Thrones of Britannia is chance based, similar to the way in which mercenaries worked in previous titles. While it’s an interesting challenge to build armies with imperfect composition and size, it has downsides too, such as elite units appearing scarcely, and losing your painstakingly assembled army can be a devastating blow to your campaign.<br>We’ve replaced this chance-based system with cooldowns. When a unit type is recruited, there’s now a set number of turns before another becomes available. This retains the sense of choice limitation, but rewards planning and removes the random punishment of not having enough units simply because they didn’t appear in the recruitment pool.<br>The time it takes to build a full army can be lengthy, so recruitment events have been added, granting a quick supply of units to help with defending territories, or adding a helpful push to your conquering.<br>Buildings, technologies and faction mechanics have all received new effects to improve the recruitment times of units. We’ve also eased the unlock requirements of military technologies, to make meaningful choices in army management more accessible.<br><br><strong>Book of Traits (Trait Browser)</strong><br>With the added importance of character traits, we believe there is more purpose to managing your characters, seeking their best development. All traits present in the game are now listed in the Book of Traits along with the condition of their acquisition.<br>The details of a trait will be locked until the player acquires that trait for the first time. (We still want players to experiment and discover traits on their own, but unlocked trait information will now be readily available).<br>The Book of Traits is persistent between campaigns, allowing players to hunt for a specific trait in a later playthrough.<br><br><strong>Buildings &amp; Settlement Maps</strong><br>Villages are getting a second, alternative building path straight from level 2. This should give players the opportunity to fine-tune their economy through minor settlements. The existing paths are vastly unchanged (safe for some minor balance tweaks) for an easier transition.<br><br>We’ve also created some new buildings that will feature on all settlement maps (both major ones and villages). <br><br>•	Viking Gatehouse<br>•	Viking Long Hall<br>•	Viking Turf-roof Hall<br>•	Viking Drinking Hall<br>•	Viking House 1<br>•	Viking House 2<br>•	Viking House 3<br>•	Viking House 4<br>•	Anglo-Saxon Chieftains House<br>•	Anglo-Saxon Great Hall (under construction)<br><br><strong>New Major Settlement Maps</strong><br>Since siege battles in Thrones of Britannia have been popular, we’re making two brand new settlement maps, one based on Bebbanburg Castle, and the other on The Rock of Cashel.<br>•	Map 1 - based on Bebbanburg Castle (used in-game for Bebbanburg and Eidenburg)<br>•	Map 2 - based on Rock of Cashel (used in-game for Caisil and Grianán Aileach)<br><br><strong>Mod Support</strong><br>Last but by no means least, we’ve made a couple of changes to help out Modders. Most notably, the Recruitment window can now accommodate any number of custom units (with a scroll-bar). Also retail pack files now contain exported binaries for all basic UI components, in addition to the already existing composite templates.<br><br><strong>And That’s Not All… </strong><br><br>The update features improvements to lots of other areas of the game, including updates to battle AI, performance optimisations, visual improvements, UI enhancements and more.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>A Total War™ Saga: Thrones of Britannia</strong></h2><br><br>The year is 878 AD, the embattled English king Alfred the Great has mounted a heroic defence at the battle of Edington, and blunted the Viking invasion. Chastened – but not yet broken – the Norse warlords have settled across Britain. For the first time in nearly 80 years, the land is in a fragile state of peace.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/712100/extras/S_BATTLE_FLYOVER.jpg?t=1699976536"" /><br><br>Throughout this sceptred isle, the kings of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales sense a time of change approaching; a time of opportunity. There will be treaties. There will be war. There will be turns of fortune that become the stuff of legend, in a saga that charts the ascent of one of history’s greatest nations.<br><br><i>Kings will rise. One will rule.</i><br><br>Thrones of Britannia is a standalone Total War game which will challenge you to re-write a critical moment in history, one that will come to define the future of modern Britain.

Throttle your enemies’ trade routes and coax them out of strong, defensible positions. <br><br><strong>Viking warlord or Anglo-Saxon king, define their legend</strong><br><br>Each faction will face a series of unique events and branching dilemmas, often based on authentic historical events and issues of the time. Embark on Viking expeditions, manage the Anglo-Saxon peasant economy, each faction feels and plays differently. Carve out unique roles for your King and Nobles, customise their impact by making meaningful choices about their development and determine how their story will unfold. <br><br><strong> ‘Classic’ Total War gameplay refined</strong><br><br>Includes many updates to core Total War mechanics - such as provinces, politics, technologies, recruitment, dilemmas and much more - designed to make your experience more immersive and more meaningful.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Playable factions, cultures and kings:</strong></h2><br><br>Thrones of Britannia will include ten playable factions, from five cultures, with a summary below. <br><br><strong>The Anglo Saxons – West Seaxe and Mierce</strong><br><br>When Roman rule in England concluded, new kingdoms of Germanic stock coalesced in the counties now known as Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, Essex, Sussex, East Anglia and Kent. The peoples of these regions came collectively to be known as the Anglo Saxons.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/712100/extras/Alfred_The_Lad.jpg?t=1699976536"" /><br><br><strong>West Seaxe</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Alfred</strong><br><br>As the dominant Anglo-Saxon kingdom of southern England, the forces of West Seaxe – or Wessex in modern English – provided the isle’s primary resistance against the incursions of the Great Heathen Army. From the capital city of Winchester, Wessex conquered lands in Surrey, Sussex, Kent, Essex and even Mercia. Alfred’s dogged defense of the Danish invasion laid the foundations for Wessex to unite England under one ruler for the first time in 927 AD.<br><br><strong>Mierce</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Ceowulf</strong><br><br>From its capital city of Tamworth, the kings of Mierce – known now as Merica - ruled the area now known as the Midlands. At its height, Mierce stretched from Northumbria in the north of England to Kent, Sussex and Wessex to the south. In 877 AD, the Great Heathen Army seized the eastern part of the kingdom to form the Danelaw, or East Engle.<br><br><strong>The Gaels – Mide and Circenn</strong><br><br>Gaelic culture initially developed in Ireland, their society built around a system of clans and chieftains. They raided and traded with Roman settlements, and by 878 AD had expanded from Ireland to inhabit much of Scotland.<br>With the influx of the Vikings, some raiders settled in Gaelic lands, becoming the Norse-Gaels. The Scottish Gaels would absorb the Picts to become the Kingdom of Alba – essentially setting the blueprint for modern Scotland. <br><br><strong>Mide</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Flann Sinna</strong><br><br>Mide lies at the heart of Ireland. Not just geographically, but politically, intellectually and spiritually. Many High Kings have risen from Mide, and its current ruler, Flann Sinna, aspires to that title.<br><br>With many fellow Irish factions nearby, Mide is in a position to potentially bring the disparate clans together, and usher in an era of Irish prosperity. However, threats are never far away… the Vikings of Dyflin have settled to the east, and their power and influence are growing. Will Mide strive to keep the uneasy peace? Unite the clans in a war against these Norse settlers? Or find some other route to supremacy?  <br><br><strong>Circenn</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Áed mac Cináeda</strong><br><br>Circenn was in origin Pictish, but became more heavily influenced by the Gaels and other peoples over time as they were driven away from the relentless Viking raids. 878 AD marked the end of the Viking invasions, but Circenn’s troubles were far from over. While she had a firm hold over the eastern coast of Scotland, many threats still exist – both within and without.   <br><br>Scoan, the capital of Circenn, was once home to the legendary Stone of Destiny, said to bestow divine strength on her people. Where the stone now resides is a mystery, but if clues can be found, surely the Stone’s recovery would be an adventure worth undertaking…<br><br><strong>The Welsh – Gwined and Strat Clut</strong><br><br>The Welsh Kingdoms descended from the Celtic Britons who occupied much of the island of Britain from the Iron Age, into and beyond its Romanisation in the First Century. <br><br>Ironically, the term ‘Welsh’ derives from the Anglo-Saxon term for foreigner, ‘wealas’, which they applied to the native Britons. The Anglo-Saxons flourished and many of the old Brittonic kingdoms began to disappear. <br><br><strong>Gwined</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: King Anaraut</strong><br><br>The people of Gwined have some claim to the title of 'true Britons', having been driven to the far west by invaders who now call themselves ‘English’. Renowned both for their bardic arts and their skill with the longbow, the Welsh of Gwined thrived under the leadership of Rhodri Mawr. <br><br>Rhodri kept Gwined largely free of Vikings and other invaders while expanding its borders. Now he is gone and his lands are divided. <br><br><strong>Strat Clut</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Run</strong><br><br>Strat Clut is a kingdom of the Old North that can be traced back to the Fifth Century and the Celtic Britons. The realm was formerly based at the fortress of Alt Clut but driven out by a Viking invasion in 870. The current King Artgal was taken captive and reportedly killed in mysterious circumstances. The kingdom reformed further into the valley of the River Clyde under the leadership of his only son Run.<br><br><strong>The Great Viking Army – Northymbre and East Engle</strong><br><br>In 865 AD, Ragnar’s sons led the Great Viking Army and made landfall in East Anglia. Over the next 15 years the Vikings ranged high and low, from Wessex to The Clyde, conquering towns, claiming victories and suffering their share of defeats until the Battle of Edington in 878 AD, where its leader Guthrum met his match in the young King Alfred and his West Saxon army. Bested in the field, his forces retreated in disarray to a nearby fortress. Flush with success, Alfred’s men gave chase and laid siege. After a fortnight of starvation, the invaders surrendered.<br><br>Under the terms of his capitulation, Guthrum was baptised into Christianity and he and his men were allowed to return to East Anglia and settle – provided they kept Alfred’s peace, of course.<br>Defeated, but never humbled, the Vikings seethe with an all-consuming rage. One does not cage the wolf without consequence…<br><br><strong>Northymbre</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Guthfrid</strong><br><br>When the Vikings arrived in Northumbria in 867 AD, they took the city of York – or Eoferwic, as was – for their stronghold. And what a bastion it was, with its formidable Roman walls still standing strong 700 years on. King Aelle of Northumbria attempted to wrest the city back from the Danes, but was captured during the attack. In retribution for Aelle’s execution of their father, the sons of Ragnar made an example of him with the horrifying Blood Eagle ritual.<br><br>Northumbria remained under Viking control and, after the battle of Edington and the subsequent treaty of Wedmore, a portion of the Great Viking Army marched back to Northumbria, to settle under Alfred’s peace.<br><br><strong>East Engle</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Guthrum</strong><br><br>Forming the bulk of Britannia’s south-easterly coast, East Engle was the staging-point of the Great Viking Army’s invasion, and the region where many of its warriors settled after the Battle of Edington. Under the rule of the Danish leader Guthrum (or Æthelstan, to use his adoptive name by Alfred) it would ultimately come to be known as the Danelaw.<br>Yet still, some fight remains in the Danes of East Engle. One does not shed the mantle of glory and become a landsman overnight.<br><br><strong>The Viking Sea Kings – Dyflin and Sudreyar</strong><br><br>After nearly a century of escalating raids, the Vikings left an indelible stamp on Britannia, altering the course of its history forever. Not least of all culturally, as many smaller bands of Vikings had settled around the isles prior to Alfred’s defeat of the Great Viking army.<br>These smaller factions traded an existence of ceaseless conflict for a new life in Britannia, establishing their own petty principalities, intermarrying and ultimately becoming part of the warp-and-woof of Britannic life. This mingling of cultures, so emblematic of British history, helped create the rich melting-pot of attitudes, beliefs and language that has made the isles and their people so unique.<br><br>Some Vikings never truly settled however; their designs were grander, their hunger for conquest and greatness unquenched. These Sea Kings would continue their bellicose work, heedless of any decree from England’s upstart ruler…<br><br><strong>Dyflin</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Bardr</strong><br><br>Dyflin was a major port town on the east coast of Ireland, and the site of Britannia’s largest slave market. It was a major site of Viking occupation, and was ruled until 873 by the Viking lord Imar, often associated with Ivar the Boneless, a son of the legendary Viking warlord Ragnar Lothbrok. Viking raiders had wintered there as early as 840 AD, so their association with the region had been a long one, and over time their customs began to take on a more Gaelic flavour as the slow process of integration took its course. <br><br>By 878 AD however, Imar’s son Bardr was firmly established on the throne. Would this ambitious Viking ruler seek to seal a lasting peace with the surrounding Gaelic factions? Or return to the ways of Ragnar, and pursue a path of bloodshed and domination? It is hard to ignore the calling of one’s warrior-blood… <br><br><strong>Sudreyar</strong><br><strong>Faction Leader: Eirik</strong><br><br>To the west of Alba lies Sudreyar, the Kingdom of the Southern Isles. Comprising the southern Hebrides, these scattered islands were sparsely populated and, bearing the full brunt of the Atlantic weather, were not lands suited to the less-hardy.<br><br>Like much of Britannia, these islands saw increasing Viking contact from the 8th Century. Prior to this period they formed part of the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada, until they fell under Viking control. Over the next century, Scandinavian occupancy took on a distinctly Gaelic flavour (and vice-versa), particularly after 872 AD when Harald Fairhair became king of Norway, and his former opponents flocked to the area.<br><br>Materially poor, but offering an excellent base for those of a nautical bent, the isles of Sudreyar are a perfect staging-post for raiders and explorers."

The battlefields are dominated by war machines known as BattleMechs. Level entire cities and decimate the enemy in your BattleMech. Follow a quest for glory and revenge. Manage an expanding mercenary company. Fight alongside your friends with a four-player PvE co-op.,"BE YOUR OWN WEAPON OF WAR<br />
Welcome to the year 3015! It’s a hell of a time to be alive.<br />
<br />
Humanity has colonized thousands of star systems spanning a vast region of space known as the Inner Sphere. The golden age of cooperation and advancement is now a distant memory, and humanity has once again splintered into disparate factions all vying for supremacy. <br />
<br />
In the midst of these Succession Wars, power hungry Mercenaries like yourself are in a privileged position to capitalize big time. It’s dangerous work but that’s why you’re here, right? If you’ve got an itch to blast, wreck, stomp and go all out ballistic, step inside and become your own weapon of war!  <br />
<br />
<br />
STORY<br />
As the inheritor of a once-prominent Mercenary company, reborn in the flames of its near destruction at the hands of conspiring factions, your quest for glory and revenge will stretch light-years as you chase threads of interstellar intrigue along your journey to becoming an elite MechWarrior and mercenary commander.<br />
<br />
<br />
THE INNER SPHERE<br />
Home to thousands of star systems and an array of stunning biomes, the Inner Sphere is alive with activity, purpose, consequence, and variety. Systems will be captured and reclaimed, major events will unfold, and new technologies will come to light.<br />
<br />
The rigors of war will be seen with each passing week as your relationships with the various factions fluctuate according to the relentless Succession Wars and your choices as the leader of a Mercenary outfit.<br />
<br />
<br />
GAMEPLAY<br />
The battlefields of the future are dominated by BattleMechs, hulking machines of war capable of leveling entire cities. As a BattleMech pilot you’ll rain havoc upon enemy ‘Mechs and targets, including tanks, ground vehicles, aircraft, advanced defenses, and reinforced bases.<br />
<br />
Few things can withstand the power of a ‘Mech for long, and the worlds of the Inner Sphere are veritable playgrounds of destruction awaiting your shielding defense or crushing devastation.<br />
<br />
<br />
BATTLEMECHS<br />
&quot;With over 50 unique ‘Mech chassis and hundreds of sub-variants, all fully-realized with high-fidelity models, damage states, and equipment, no two ‘Mechs are the same!<br />
Whether acquired from scouring the markets of the Inner Sphere for rare and valuable chassis and equipment, or salvaging directly from the wreckage of your annihilated enemies and the spoils of war, the maintenance and operation of your BattleMechs will be vital to your success both as a MechWarrior and a Mercenary outfit commander.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
THE MERC LIFE<br />
Off the battlefield, as the leader of a Mercenary company you will need to manage all the key components of running a unit.<br />
<br />
You’ll need to maintain and acquire ‘Mechs and equipment, hire and field MechWarriors from throughout the Inner Sphere to join you on the battlefield, and manage your relationships with the Great Houses of the Inner Sphere, all of whom are vying for your contribution to their staggering war efforts.<br />
<br />
Of course, with each Contract comes negotiation, and with each victory comes consequence.<br />
<br />
<br />
OTHER FEATURES<br />
With the vast scope of the Inner Sphere and its complex system of world generation providing huge variety and replayability, the MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries experience offers no end. Outside the campaign, a fully-featured Instant Action system will allow you to customize and kick off isolated missions at any time, free from campaign restrictions.<br />
<br />
With four-player co-op supported both within the campaign and the Instant Action system, you can experience the full breadth of the MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries universe alongside your friends.<br />

(If you're the only user of your PC, this is probably you)<br></li><li> OVR Toolkit only supports Windows 10 and 11. (This is due to the desktop capture API we use which was only introduced in Windows 10)<br></li><li> Oculus users, don't launch OVR Toolkit through Oculus Home as it will launch the application incorrectly! Use Steam/SteamVR instead! You can set OVR Toolkit to auto-start with SteamVR by referring to our wiki!<br></li><li> Oculus' software will sometimes overlay over our overlay. (This is because Oculus' software displays separate to SteamVR, our application will always display whilst SteamVR is active or you're playing a SteamVR game, just not when you open the Oculus Dashboard)<br></li><li> Oculus users, refer to the OVR Toolkit wiki 'Oculus' page for how to make OVR Toolkit appear in your games!<br></li><li> We cannot display our application over Oculus SDK games. (Our application uses SteamVR to display, though, most Oculus games will have a SteamVR mode, we advise you use this!)<br></li><li> Running games through SteamVR on an Oculus headset may decrease performance, this is not an issue specific to OVR Toolkit. This is due to Oculus rendering the same image twice, once when SteamVR compositor renders the output, then again when Oculus Runtime renders the output. Unfortunately, this is something only Oculus/Facebook can fix!<br></li><li> Windows Mixed Reality users may experience decreased performance running SteamVR games due to double rendering. Please try performance with your games running through SteamVR before you purchase OVR Toolkit. (Most noticeable effects with Flight Simulator 2020)</li></ul> If you have any issues with the application or find other compatibility issues, don't hesitate to contact us!

You are Mordred, brought back to life to find Arthur, and ultimately, kill him to end this accursed condition.<br><br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1157390/extras/anim_Resurrect.gif?t=1715275835"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Round Table reborn</h2>Gather your knights and send them on quests involving deep, tactical battles!

So you can find many familiar stories in your life as Deja-vu scene.<br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Theme</h2></strong><br>In our creative process, we found that the Internet is more important in our life than everyone's imagination. Social events always have different opinions in the real world. And there is always has a little group of people who enjoy judging others, and because of that, the events would be more complicated, even leading emergencies to happen. When information flow quickly transforms in every place of the world, immorality and illegal news always happen. In this process, more and more people enjoy being judging process.<br><br>After careful consideration, we decided to make an amazing game to let people really know about the dangers of internet world. We focus on the <strong><i>dark web</i></strong>, <strong><i>truly cybercrime</i></strong> and <strong><i>privacy burglary</i></strong>, tried to let gamers can experience being a hacker in the real world. Every little operation would affect the life of the characters in the game, which would let you rethink the relationship between people and the internet.<br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Features</h2></strong><br>You can do some really hack in our game:<br><br><strong><i>·Web search</i></strong><br>You should collect basic information about the targets through the Internet search.<br><br><strong><i>·Database</i></strong><br>You can use the database to get deep information about targets.<br><br><i><strong>·Crack</strong></i><br>You would get passwords based on the obtained target's information, and use it to log in to accounts of different platforms (including email, social media, chat application, etc.)<br><br><i><strong>·Chat</strong></i><br>The exciting thing is that you need to chat with targets by disguise and use the information to get the trust of the target.<br><br><i><strong>·Picture Analysis</strong></i><br>You can get valuable information and relevant clues from pictures.<br><br><i><strong>·Phishing</strong></i><br>You can send phishing links to hack the targets' hardware devices (computer, mobile phone), and get private information.<br><br>More advanced hacking methods will be unlocked later!<br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Gameplay</h2></strong><br><strong>·Highly Immersive</strong><br>Gamers play as a hacker in the game, accepts the commission of the company, and solve dangerous incidents.<br><br><strong>·Rich Gameplay</strong><br>There are lots of features of Social Engineering in the game, which is including Detecting, Tracking, Puzzles-Solving, Destroying and Hacking etc..<br><br><strong>·Complex Story</strong><br>The game will judge the good and evil of the player's behavior. Different judgments will lead to different plot directions.<br><br><strong>·Multiple Roles</strong><br>There are many different roles in this game with a flash of personality. Their stories would be dug by yourself.<br><strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Written in the end</h2></strong><br>When we decided on the subject matter of the game, we thought about it for a long time. Because of <strong><i>This War of Mine</i></strong>, <strong><i>Papers, Please</i></strong>, <strong><i>Orwell</i></strong> and other excellent indie games, we also want to make a game that allows gamers to think outside the game. We tried so many times to brainstorm.<br>We set up a Social Engineering group to find some experts and ask them about the skills for giving gamers a real hacking experience. We even read the book <strong><i>The Art of Deception</i></strong> written by the famous hacker Kevin David Mitnick to figure out how a real hacker's works. These studies directly opened the door to a new world for all of us. The disciplines involved social engineering, psychology, micro-expressions, phrase skills and so on, which kinds of studies make us have great confidence in the theme of the game and gameplay.<br>Not just professionals and books, we also get inspiration from cinema. For example, through <strong><i>Who Am I: No System Is Safe</i></strong>, we have seen another explanation about hacking skills. Through <strong><i>Searching</i></strong> we have learned how to create storytelling in details and how to let the audiences and games focus on where we expect them to focus. Every times learning makes us closer to the game in my heart.<br><br>So as we mentioned before, this game is very <strong><i>special and unique</i></strong> which combines a lot of creativity. I really hope that you guys could like this game so much. Please feel free to leave your advice and feedback in Community."

UNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING<br />
Take back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.<br />
<br />
AMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY<br />
All 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.<br />
<br />
REINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS<br />
Connect with Facebook and Game Center friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.<br />
<br />
SHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS<br />
Build up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.<br />

Also, he is an egocentric pig. Adores to drink and in general he's enjoying his life. But after the treasury had emptied and even raising taxes had not helped, it became clear that he could not continue his leisurely lifestyle. Which is a problem. Mostly yours. Because peasants, who are not fond of raised taxes and hunger, are rioting in your feud. King demands you put down the rebellion and go to the distant land to get some gold. (Rumors are there is one where there are tons of it) Will you do as your sovereign bids and set sail to replenish the palace coffers ? Will you join the violent leader of rebels to bring the tyrant to justice ? Will you help poor natives of Uncharted Continent ? Or will you cast aside human nature and ambition and lead armies of Undead ? Questions, questions, questions.

Just make sure your troops have towers to shoot from and clear lines of sight, or you might find your best-laid plans embarrassingly blunted by your own fortifications.

Build houses, bury fallen soldiers and peasants to prevent plague, and treat the infected when death comes knocking. If you do not care for your people you may soon find yourself overrun with the most unpleasant troubles.

The enemy will not cede their lands willingly, and unprotected civilian expansions will have consequences of falling prey to the hostile incursion.

There is a dark history of tainted power that stirs zombies and traps wayward souls. On the lighter side: it can also be used to call down really very big fireballs onto your enemies.

Crisis is a time for action and decisive steps...","You are a young teenage Jackie from the ghetto who wants to get out of poverty and embark on a journey of learning about the world and yourself. <br />
<br />
 The world has definitely gone crazy, though it has never been normal, but maybe now is the chance for you. Crisis is a time for action and decisive steps...except it's scary, because every step can set you back far. <br />
<br />
Sometimes it is difficult to choose the right path, but do not be afraid, you can always repeat, we learn from mistakes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Jackie is to learn that to get to a new place you must first make a jump and get off the ground, not knowing what will happen in the future...<br />
A samurai has no goal, only a way, stoicism, patience and cunning will help you to reach the very top, but what awaits there - you never know...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Only UP!&quot; is inspired by the fairytale &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; and reminds some of a platformer. You'll follow the same mythological path as Jack to achieve something more than just climbing to the very top.<br />
<br />
Among the features of the game are the ability to slow down time and change the speed of your character to be as collected as possible when making an important step or jump. The game also contains hundreds of Easter eggs and various references.<br />
<br />
Note that the game has no save points - the point is that each successive level raised the stakes in the game, the higher you climb the more painful to fall ... but who has not fallen, he has not risen<br />
This makes the game more tense and nervous, but that's the point - to reach the top need to step over his fear and irritability, to calm down and slowly but surely move toward the goal - to the top! After all, the main thing is not the goal, but the path.<br />
<br />
... The average passing time of the game 40 - 120 minutes And to infinity (!!! record less than 23 minutes!!) If you like dynamic shooters, or you're the kind of person who gives up easily, think before you buy the game.  But with a certain approach, the game can give you a sense of freedom and space.<br />
<br />
... the journey of 10,000 steps begins with the first step ..."
