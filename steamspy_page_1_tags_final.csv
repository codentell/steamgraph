						 A thousand years ago, the crusaders of Azunai crossed swords with the legions of Zaramoth in the final battle of a century-long rebellion. As the tyrannical god Zaramoth struck the final blow through Azunai’s trembling shield, the earth shook. In that moment, the forces of magic were unchained, and both armies were consumed in a brilliant cataclysm that stretched for leagues across the Plain of Tears. Only a scarred wasteland remained as final testament to the First Age of Man.<br />
						 And for a millennium, magic has continued to spread to the farthest corners of the world, freely flowing to any who would command it. But the tide of magic has begun to wane, heeding instead the call of an ancient legacy. From the Plain of Tears a new heir beckons, and with each day his strength grows. Consuming those who submit, eradicating those who resist. With none to oppose his ascendance, the circle will be complete, and an ancient age will begin anew.<br />

Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. You'll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time.

It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders, while also unlocking new battlefield equipment, aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them. </li></ul><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission, improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans, but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire...</li></ul><ul class=""bb_ul""><li> Detailed, Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions, just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such, no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area, you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and you'll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked, you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base.

Broadcasters can easily make parties to play with their communities while stream viewers can bet on players, change the rules of the game in real-time, compete in mini-games, and more to become (in)famous on the stream, all by using Streamote.tv, a unique website integrated on desktop, mobile, or tablet. Streamline is the perfect game for Sub Sundays, Follower Fridays , or just playing together with your friends.<br> <br><i>Elimination Mode</i> <br><br>Throughout Early Access, Proletariat is developing multiple game modes for Streamline, each featuring one or more broadcasters, up to 16 Players, and tens, or even hundreds of, thousands of Viewers. In the first mode, ‘Elimination’, players free-run around the maps, gather points, and avoid the competition. The Hunter tracks down the Runners and eliminates them from play while streaming to the Viewers. Viewers can bet on the best Runner to win big, change the rules of the game in real-time, and play mini-games like Bingo. Give your Runner an edge by turning the floor into lava or bringing them back from the dead or help the Hunter by restricting the Runners’ movements or making them explode if they touch each other!<br> <br><i>The Story So Far</i> <br><br>Set in the near future, Streamline pits Runners vs. Hunters in a new sport enhanced by augmented reality and physical skills. After growing tired of mainstream sports with their limited mechanics, overblown sponsorships, and corporate greed, the Streamline Pro League was formed. Taking advantage of their dilapidated surroundings, players in the SPL run, jump, and fly through abandoned shipyards, vacant schoolyards, and crumbling skyscrapers while live streaming all of it to their adoring fans. Runners want to gather up as many points as they can while avoiding the Hunter.

The game was supported for many years with 6 full brand new sets of cards being released over time. However, the developers Lightmare Studios were a very small, young studio. There were a lot of industry-standard practices that the team just didn’t know about. Zero comments were left on the code, little to no documentation on coding standards was made, and each and every card was hard coded with its effects, creating massive amounts of redundancy, and what experts would refer to as “spaghetti code”. This led to increasingly severe technical difficulties, and the team was tunnel visioned on chasing features and new set releases, exacerbating problems.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">With no way to fix the problem, we signed our game over to our Publisher to let them handle it, however, the problems were much too severe to be fixed even by them, and even small bug fixes became monumental tasks. It wasn’t long before the game was left as it was, with the servers being hosted, but no significant support. And in 2019, Lightmare took back the servers to prevent them from being shut down. Despite the game significantly draining resources, it was kept online for a further year as a service to the few players who remained, before we finally had to put the servers on ice.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Shortly after, we finally broke the news that we were working on Infinity Wars Classic - a technical remaster built from the ground up using the Infinity Card Engine (born through Infinity Heroes’ early development) to be a much more technically functional version of the game our fans had enjoyed playing for years. In October 2020, we released our Pre-alpha version 0.01 of IWC, which featured only 49 cards. As of September 2022, we’re now in public free access, but still in active development towards a fully remastered product, and currently has all Infinity Wars 1 cards (not including 3rd party ones) and the first 60 from the upcoming Intrigue set, due for release on the 10th of September 2022. It features a brand new deckbuilder, and in the backend a module-based card creation system, allowing for far more frequent content. </p><p class=""bb_paragraph""></p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">We want to do right by our oldest players, so one of the biggest things I want to highlight is that players from Infinity Wars 1’s time can import their IW1 collections into IWC. That means your old collections you spent time and money on are going to be yours eventually. This is currently available in game, and you can make the request from the profile page. Using the same email as your Infinity Wars 1 account will minimise wait time on porting your collection over.</p>"

When our friends play tested our game they’d instinctively button mash, they couldn’t help themselves. It must have been the many years of playing other brawlers that engraved it in their minds the notion of rapidly pressing buttons to kill your foes. The game’s designed in such a way that if you button mash, you die. Every press matters. Although playing the game should still be simple, you see a bad guy in front of you, you attack him, he dies.

Now a standalone title with tons of new content &amp; improvements!","<i>Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut</i> is a standalone release of Harebrained Schemes' critically-acclaimed <i>Dragonfall</i> campaign, which first premiered as a major expansion for <i>Shadowrun Returns</i>. The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game: 5 all-new missions, alternate endings, new music, a redesigned interface, team customization options, a revamped combat system, and more - making it the definitive version of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience. <br><br>NOTE: The <i>Director’s Cut</i> is free to existing owners of the <i>Dragonfall</i> expansion for <i>Shadowrun Returns</i>. It will be automatically added to your Steam Library when the game is released.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Man Meets Magic &amp; Machine</h2>In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. <br><br><br>It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. <br><br>Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…<h2 class=""bb_tag""><i>Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut</i> Features</h2><strong>A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: <i>Dragonfall</i> hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development. Immerse yourself in a smart, 20+ hour campaign with a diverse cast of all-too-human characters.<br><br><strong>A One-of-a-Kind Cyberpunk Setting:</strong> Experience the unique “Tech meets Magic” dystopian future of Shadowrun, a fan-favorite game setting now celebrating it’s 25th anniversary. <i>Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut</i> is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into.<br><br><strong>Command Your Team:</strong> Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in.<br><br><strong>Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat:</strong> When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices.<br><br><strong>Skill-Based Character Progression:</strong> Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems. Shadowrun: Dragonfall’s classless skill system allows you to grow your character in any direction you choose.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">New in the <i>Director’s Cut</i></h2><strong>Standalone: </strong>Due to popular demand, <i>Dragonfall</i> is now a completely standalone title!<br><br><strong>Five All-New Missions:</strong> The <i>Director’s Cut</i> features five all-new original missions, including three related directly to the personal stories of your team members. These missions take you to previously-unseen locales - both within the Flux State and beyond - where you’ll have to face challenging enemies and make tough choices in order to help your team members prevail.<br><br><strong>Revamped Combat System:</strong> The <i>Dragonfall</i> combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions.<br><br><strong>Redesigned Interface:</strong> The <i>Dragonfall</i> in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter.<br><br><strong>Customize Your Team:</strong> Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities. In addition, if you don’t like a team member’s default spell, item or weapon loadout, you can now customize what they bring on each mission.<br><br><strong>Ten New Pieces of Original Music:</strong> Fan-favorite composer Jon Everist brings ten new tracks of moody cyberpunk music to the <i>Dragonfall</i> experience, including compositions based on the stories of individual members of your team.<br><br><strong>The Complete Dragonfall Soundtrack:</strong> As a free bonus, the <i>Director’s Cut</i> includes the entire soundtracks from both <i>Dragonfall</i> AND our previous title, <i>Shadowrun Returns</i>. This also includes the brand new tracks exclusive to the <i>Director’s Cut</i>.

Long before “Metroidvania” was a thing, we fell in love with the original Castlevania series, as well as with other Hall of Famers such as the Metroid, Contra, and Ninja Gaiden games. About halfway through the lifecycle of the first-generation PlayStation, sprite-based game development took an unfortunate nosedive, and the sorts of games we loved most and grew up with just weren't being made as frequently or, frankly, with as much love and care as they once were.<br><br>Indie game development really helped to reinvigorate both the sprite-based action-platformer genre and the magic of actual sprite animation. rdein's games combine what we’ve always loved about tight-action 2D gaming with splendid influences from more modern games like Dark Souls. The dedication to your actions necessitated by animation locks; the insane intensity driving the boss fights and how epic it is that this quaint little heroine can tackle these heroic endeavors; the attention to detail in the environments, designs, and animations... all of this stuff is simply stunning and rdein pulls it off to beautiful effect.<br><br>Then there’s also the story itself, which is also a masterpiece in game storytelling: a strange, mysterious world that you inhabit with countless hopeless souls whom you are trying to save. There is painstaking detail in every item, every snippet of dialogue. You find yourself constantly readjusting how you feel about these people. You're trying to save them, but do they even want to be saved? Or should you be more worried about that awkwardly sinister tone in their voices...?<br><br>Momodora: RUTM shouldn’t exactly be categorized as “Metroidvania” or “Souls-like”, but there certainly are elements of both contained within. It's a game of its own, and it’s one of the best entries in the mind-bogglingly expansive genre of side-scrolling action-platformers. We at Playism all love the game, and we can state with absolute confidence that if you’ve bothered to read this far, then you certainly will, too."

The player in this game is free to play as they want. Control one player on the virtual field.  Kick the ball high or low, hard or lightly, curve, lob, jump, dribble and perform tricks. Create or find your team and join tournaments. Discover a multiplayer soccer game played by over 1 million players.   </p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Gameplay</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Soccer Online: Ball 3D is an immersive computer game where you have 100% control over the angle of your kicks. Every awesome goal you score depends only on your skills, but be careful as every mistake you make is also only your fault. The physics is powered by the professional physics engine, which ensures realistic ball behavior like in the real-life soccer. Because this is a physics-driven game, you need to use the geometry of the in-game objects and the physical forces (including gravity) to control them.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Shooting and passing is as easy as clicking one button. Third person camera makes the gameplay very dynamic and unique among soccer video games (some call them football games). It's the first time you can play football like this, very unique and rich experience in the electronic gaming world. At last a game that lets you perform pixel perfect moves and put the ball where you want. It is uniquely satisfying to see how the goal net moves after you score or how the whole goal moves after you hit the goalpost. Open yourself to an atmospheric, magic reality, gain access to a new world where your unreal fantasy of becoming a soccer player will come true. Every competitive gamer will enjoy this.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Not many aaa titles offer what you will find in Ball 3D, one of the best, highest rated Steam games with great reviews. If you are looking for almost free Steam games, this hidden gem may be the best choice. This game is a true marvel for soccer fans, offering unmatched realism and endless  fun.    </p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Welcome new players!</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">After you enter the game, a short tutorial awaits you. It will teach you how to move, jump, shoot, curve and sprint (dash). New players need just 3 minutes on average to learn the basics of the game including the movement. You might feel lost and strange when you start your journey in Ball 3D, the gameplay may look odd, but the tutorial will help you understand what the game is about. Feel free to train your aim and other moves in the tutorial for as long as you want, you can also come back to it later. It is recommended to finish the tutorial before going online, but don't worry it is short and simple. It will help you massively to improve during the humble beginnings of your career. Your skill will rise quickly after finishing it, you will be far better, so it is worth your time. Tutorial is like a sandbox that lets you play and practice your moves and tricks. After some training you may aim with the precision of a sniper. If you are not sure how to play the game, all your doubts will be gone after finishing the tutorial. Return to it as often as you need.   </p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Bots are ready to play</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">If you would like to practice the moves you just learned,  next step in your education may be playing versus bots (AI). Test your new skills. You can choose from 4 difficulty levels and decide if you would like to train being the striker or the goalkeeper. Ball 3D is mainly not a singleplayer offline PvE game, but you may decide that it is too early to play with real people and prefer to try the game solo in a calm environment before going online. Once you play a few games with bots, you will feel more confident. Say &quot;hello&quot; to the bots, they never answer a single word, but they always listen...</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">When you are new, bots may be challenging. If you will lose against them, there is no need to be sad and cry, you can play with them as many times as you want! Challenge them to a rematch. Don't turn your brain off, focus, keep trying and you will eventually deal with this steep challenge after a couple games and make incremental progress. They will help you to unleash your hidden potential. Or maybe you think the bots are too easy for your? Don't underrate them!   </p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Soccer Online</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Explore the world of online soccer! Playing vs bots is so fun, but this is a multi-player esport game. It's time to go online in the cross-platform multiplayer mode and play with other humans over the internet (or local network). We support new players a lot. During the first 14 days you have a beginner status. It lets you play on the special rooms marked as beginners. You can use this time to familiarize yourself with the game by playing with players at your level. If you feel you are too good to play on the rooms for beginners, you can always join the normal rooms available for all players. After 14 days you will turn into an expert and you will be able to play on the 3rd kind of rooms, available only for the experts. Thanks to all this you can always play soccer online with the players at your level. On the expert rooms you will stumble upon highly skilled players (with over 1k hours in the game!), watch them carefully as you can learn a lot from them. Exciting and addictive Co-Op/PvP gameplay is the strongest element of this independent game.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Multiplayer</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Speaking of rooms. You can play on dedicated rooms or you can join rooms hosted by other players. You can also create your own room. The game offers very advanced and optimized network code, including client side prediction anti-lag system and great dedicated servers in various regions that offer low ping. Ball 3D is one of the most dynamic coop soccer games, yet the network code is able to handle this in a very smooth way making the online multiplayer experience very enjoyable. If you like multiplayer or mmo games you will love it. Try it yourself. On dedicated rooms the decisions are made by voting. Press F1 if you agree or F2 if you disagree. Remember to use sprint to increase your speed and outrun your opponents.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Teams</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Sooner or later you will meet some nice people in the world of Ball 3D, use the chat to get to know them better. You may build a team (clan, guild) with them. Choose a name/tag (FC The Best, AS Best Players, EAS-Vampires, Foot Monsters (FM), Greatest Among Many (GAM) or any other you can imagine) and create it in the user panel, then invite your friends to join the party and become a real team coach/manager. Remember to create some nice-looking shirts for your new club. When you do so, you will be ready to compete in global leagues, cups and tournaments. Your players can dress in these shirts for the match. Wouldn't it be nice to join the elite and win the Ball 3D World Cup Grand Final? Wouldn't it be nice to say &quot;I'm the best, I am the master of the game&quot;? Write your own myth, be on top and become a living legend, the undisputed best Ball 3D player on the planet earth (the Greatest Of All Time - GOAT). From zero to hero, fulfill your American dream! It is your destiny to be the best! To achieve this you will need a skillful squad and some effective strategy that will crush the other teams. But remember that the result of the match is unknown till the last whistle, so never idle during the game!    </p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">You are in the driver’s seat, steering your team to victory. Your duty as the manager will be to form a team (hopefully a dream team). The total number of people in your team is up to you, you can invite 1 friend or 5 friends, 6, 7, 10. Not enough? How about 20, 24, 26 or even more. Your choice is important. You will need players in your team that will play on goalkeeper, defense and attack. Players can switch during the game. Cooperation is the secret formula and the key to success. Your galactic team may try to play positional attacks or it may defend the goal like a tank, lock the penalty area, turn it into a fortress and try counter attacks. Parking a bus in the goal is a sensible tactic too, don't be ashamed to use it, it's ok. Picking the best tactic for your team is like solving a puzzle, you need to be creative and use your head and logic to fit the pieces. It is your role to decide if you want to play with one striker or with two, with three defenders or with four. You may try accurate short passes in tight spaces and technical shots or full power flat strikes from the middle of the field. You may also try individual dribbling, but it is risky, use it at your own risk. Play the first half with one tactic and the second with another. You can easily go from defensive to offensive and vice versa. Some play styles are more dangerous than others. You never know which tactics will be your best bet, try all possible ideas and alternatives. Invent some high IQ plays and see how they work. Everything is up to you, this is your empire. Your team is like a kingdom and you are the king. Stealing tactics from your opponents is not theft, all methods and tricks are good to win!</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Man of the match</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Every move you make during the match is recorded in the form of statistics. Based on these statistics a ranking of players is formed. By the end of the match, the name of the best player will be featured and shown on the board as the man (woman) of the match. Do your best to put your name there (by playing well and scoring points) and become popular! It tastes really wonderful to reach the apex and become the hero of the match.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Replays</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">You can record all your matches and watch them later. Replays will help you craft your soccer skills into an art. Watching and analyzing matches will greatly accelerate your skill growth rate. You can watch the matches from various cameras, including: TV, Action, Top Down, Follow Player and several others. Remember to record replays and save your &quot;wow&quot; goals so you can watch them later and show them to your friends.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Soccer variations</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">This indie game contains many different stadiums and modes. If normal soccer is not enough for you, you can try modes like: Darts, Ping Pong and others. Ball 3D is a super fun and deep co-operative game not similar to any other. You will always find something to enjoy in this game.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">More than soccer</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Ball 3D is not only soccer, but also other sports for you to enjoy on-line together with your friends. You will be surprised when you will see the other sports: Basketball, Handball, Ice Hockey, Racing, Battle Royale and more. Each of them has their own stadiums and unique rules.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Battle Royale takes place on a circular arena with no escape. Survival is the key to the win in this combat, there can be only one survivor in this clash. Carefully overwatch the entire battlefield and avoid your opponents at all cost or turn into a hunter and hunt your enemies. Fight and beat them (by jumping and falling on them with the force of thunder, it is not a shooter, you don't have guns and bullets, there is no crosshair, the only weapon you have is you). At the same time you need to dodge the ball that is chasing you, just like in dodgeball. In Battle Royale you win only when all your rivals are &quot;dead&quot; (no one is left on the battleground except you). Use your reflex to win this epic war.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">The racing mode is like a kart racer, but with discs (the same you control while playing other sports). They can drift and are very fast. During the race you use your mouse and keyboard as a controller. In  Hockey mode you play with a puck on the ice.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Soccer Online: Ball 3D is a multi-sport simulation game available on laptop/desktop PC (Windows), Mac/Macbook (MacOS) and Steam Deck (Linux). Absolutely unique soccer sim action game for casual, hardcore and pro players, where not only your realtime reaction skills matter, but also tactics. It mix arcade gameplay with strategy. Randomly clicking the keys like in some clicker games will not give you much, you need to think about your next moves like in chess and then execute them (often in a split second) using your skills. Ball 3D is a fascinating fast-paced, easy to play, hard to master e-sport game with unique mechanics. Great to play in 2024, 2025 and even in   2026. Play daily from monday to friday and on the weekend, all week! It may be a light, relaxing and cozy experience, a game you can play while listening to your favorite podcast in the background or a harsh and intense one. Unlike many RPG games where you level up your character, here your quest is to improve yourself and write your own story. Here you grind your own skill.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">You don't need to be a soccer fan to enjoy Ball 3D! No matter if you prefer golf, tennis, pool, baseball, cricket, volleyball or any other olympic sport, you will still like Ball 3D. Especially that your favorite sport may be sooner or latter added to the game. Let us know what sports would you like to see in the game.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Different environments</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">You can customize the environment, play on the grass, darker grass, dried grass, sand (desert), snow, concrete or rust-colored gravel. With the audience or without it. You can change the weather and pick if you want to play during the sunny summer, cold snowy winter, rainy autumn or green spring. Do you prefer the daylight or the dark night? Clean hot sky, clouds or maybe a rain? You can play on the Classic stadium, Real stadium, Small stadium, Big stadium, Mega stadium, Huge stadium, a street city stadium called Urban and many others. Ball 3D is a colorful, peaceful, family friendly, non-violent (no violence, no blood) game about soccer with a bit of the old retro vibe, that will give you a lot of fun. The graphics are pretty nice too, you might not necessarily  want to set it as your wallpaper, but you will like it for sure! It can be played by players of all age, kids and adults, boys and girls. No matter if you are 18, 25 or 50 years old, boomer or young, this game is for you. Your girlfriend/boyfriend will love it too!</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Other features</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">The game also offers Steam Trading Cards and Achievements among many other features not mentioned here. One of the achievements requires you to send some love to other players by sending them a heart. You can buy and sell in-game items for a very cheap price on the Steam Market (cheapest are for less than 0.99  dollars). Get free items (loot inside the boxes) for playing the game (you don't need to pay any money for them, just play and the items will drop as a thank you for your effort) and then put them on sale or go to the market and look for some best-sellers for yourself. You can also gift the items to your friends. Also remember to visit the shop, where you can find paid items and some attractive discounted bundles that offer great value (halloween bundles, christmas bundle, valentine bundle and others).</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">In Ball 3D you have a lot of settings, if your computer is bad, you can tweak the graphics and other settings to get more fps. From the screen resolution, vsync and fov to the quality of the grass. When you change settings in the menu, you will hear chill music from an excellent soundtrack (we hope you enjoy these rhythms). The game is optimized very well and it will work on all computers (even if you have a potato pc) including low spec hardware (use minimalist graphics settings). The size of the game is optimized too and it only requires much less than 1 GB of storage.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">But that's not all! After you score a goal, you can turn yourself into a rocket, horse, dinosaur, fish, alien, pirate, hat guy, iron knight, spider, ufo, werwolf, zombie, evil slime, angry log and many other fictional, scary but cartoony monsters, plants and wild animals you may know from horror and sci-fi movies, cartoons or from the zoo. The list of possible celebrations is much longer, if staying on the ground after a goal is not enough, you can go into the air like a bird and enjoy a plane flight celebration. If this is still not enough, then you can celebrate the goal by turning into a gang of farming farmers, cops or drive a police car. And if you are bored, you may ask the other players to create a tower (just jump on each other). How cool and funny is that? When you finish celebrating, you can watch your goal again thanks to the auto-replays.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">You can use stylized visual shot effects like: shadow, ghost, black trail, white shuriken, fire ball, mystic beam, dying star, glossy sparks, red devil from hell, rainbow cubes, ancient artifact and countless others. They do not affect the gameplay or the power of the shot, but they look really nice and you may always disable them if you want.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">You can show some emotions to other players by using special emotion items, the list of them is long. Here are some: cute cat, pumpkin smile, jaw, mummy, wolf, angel, crazy kiss, laugh, XD, lol, omg (oh my god), rage, shock, bat and many others.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">You can use badges to stand out. Here are some you can use: wizard, dog, cave, storm, rocks, candy, portal, toxic river, toxic bubbles, loops, dwarf, moon surface, dragon, underground, warrior, hand, elf, heat map, spooky and countless others.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">If that's not enough for you, you can make your avatar look better by wearing items like: golden chain, witch hat or shaman hat.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">The list of items in the game is very long. Many of them you will get just by playing, the rest is available in the shop.</p><p class=""bb_paragraph"">Soccer Online: Ball 3D is great for streams, if you are a streamer try to play it with your viewers.</p><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Updates</h2><p class=""bb_paragraph"">It is noteworthy that the game has been already updated over 250 times.

These elements course through the world, sometimes clashing and causing earth-shattering changes. Gaia houses a number of various biomes, including lush forests, soaring peaks of ice-capped mountains, a towering volcano clouded with sulfur and ash, as well as breezy floating islands, ominous dark forests, wide swamps, and deep caverns.

As a result, Archos’s atmosphere has been adversely affected, causing some strange occurrences on the planet during the night. During the day, Archos’s landscape is peaceful, but once the sun sets, the planet immediately plunges into chaos. Occasionally, the remnants of Gaia will block out the sun, causing an eclipse on Archos, resulting in a violent, bloodthirsty frenzy among the planet's native creatures. Eclipses also provide an opportunity to obtain incredibly rare magical resources, so players must learn to survive during eclipses if they want to thrive.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/529180/extras/y-3.png?t=1666906165"" /><br><br>Magic permeates throughout everything Dark and Light, and the line between physical and magical becomes increasingly blurred as the game progresses.

Possibilities aren't just limited to creation and control, however.

This is particularly true in regards to group combat, where supporting and managing a diverse battalion of warriors, mages, trainers, and more will grant you a major advantage in large-scale battles.<br>Players can choose to start in one of three main cities, each one belonging to one of the three ruling factions on Archos. This community structure is critical in the early stages of the game, when players are relatively weak and need support from others.

Many years after the banishment of the evil that plagued the land, the world was hit by waves of unbearable heat. Now in order to save the world the band of young adventurers have set upon a quest to vanquish the Sun.","STORY<br />
<br />
The world is dying. Many years after the banishment of the evil that plagued the land, the world was hit by waves of unbearable heat. Crops are withering, rivers and wells drying and the cattle is slowly dying out from illness.<br />
<br />
During his desperate work to save his family farm from the heat, young farmer named Jory was suddenly visited by a mysterious stranger claiming that the land could be saved and that he is the one who can help save it.<br />
<br />
Despite his skepticism, in desperation he accepted the strangers offer and was instantly transferred to a strange flying metal contraption where three other people waited.<br />
<br />
The stranger explained to them that the thing that plagues this world is not a natural, but man made disaster. An evil and immortal tyrant, together with his evil legions from times past is manipulating the Sun that heats their world and the very fabric of time. All to fulfill his goal of utter time and space domination. Coming from a time where the tyrant already established domination, the stranger known as Cooper came back in an attempt to rewrite time and thus save both present and the future from utter destruction.<br />
<br />
He explained to his four guests that even though they are not warriors they all carry genes of great heroes of the past. Using his superior technology he can make Jory and his new friends capable of combating any threat that comes their way.<br />
<br />
GAMEPLAY<br />
<br />
Each character will choose his own unique class among the rich variety that &quot;The Space Crusade&quot; offers. Despite this, they will not only be defined by their class of choice, but also with their inherent abilities (i.e. farmer Jory will be more sturdy then his companions, while grifter Laura will be more agile then the rest). Every class will be able to use a wide variety of abilities that will enable them to combat their more technologically advanced foes. The number of possible encounters is fixed, so there will not be any tedious level grinding. After each level up the player will choose new skills, and with it the way their characters develop combat-wise. Goal of the game is to reach the Sun where the tyrant resides while combating his legions, both human and mutated monstrosities.<br />
<br />
CHARACTERS<br />
<br />
Jory - small town farmer with a wild youth, but after his father died he settled down to run his family farm in his honor.<br />
<br />
Dante - young scholar with an interest in engineering. He accepted Cooper's call to observe his advanced technology.<br />
<br />
Laura - grifter from the Capital City that joined Cooper to flee the guards chasing her after her last scam.<br />
<br />
Victoria - initiate in a secluded temple yearning for adventure and an opportunity to help her fellow man.<br />
<br />
Cooper - time-traveling stranger from a ruined future. He traveled back in time to stop the problem at its root. Pilot of the vessel &quot;Solarius&quot;, and leader of the team."

Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!<br><br>The Technology:<br><br>Unfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting. <br><br>Yes I worked hard to bring this game to life, may you all inflict carnage upon it!"

You will build the airport’s infrastructure with everything from runways and taxiways, gates and aprons to constructing terminals with check-in, security, restaurants and shops. You will manage the business perspective of the airport by hiring employees and executives, making deals with airline companies and making sure that ends meet by keeping an eye on budget and resources. <br><br>You will have to cater to the passengers by keeping waiting time to a minimum, by having friendly and helpful staff around and by making passengers feel secure, keeping any potential incidents at bay; a happy passenger is a spending passenger. Hopefully you won’t run into any problems such as stressed out employee, equipment breakdowns or bad weather which can cause massive delays or even emergency landings. You will be held accountable when things go wrong and filthy rich when things go right.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673610/extras/the_gameplay.png?t=1725232871"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Running an airport</h2>Your objective is to build and manage your airport to perfection by making strategic decisions, designing the optimal airport layout and ultimately making sure that your passengers and airlines are satisfied. You will need to build the entire airport from scratch including terminal foundations with floors, walls, doors and items as well as the airport infrastructure including runways, taxiways, aprons and other airport infrastructure. Everything in Airport CEO is deeply simulated and it is your job to make sure it all runs smoothly and with a positive bank account.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Airlines</h2>Airlines and their travelers are an essential element of Airport CEO as they consist of the main source of your airport’s income. Signing contracts with airlines bring cash-flow and passengers to your airport which in term means opportunities for receiving different service fees, as well as passenger expenditures. Airlines come in different sizes and have different requirements on your airport and the services you offer, you are responsible for not only planning the flight schedule but also for meeting and maintaining the needs. Occasionally you will need to handle emergencies and delays due to bad weather or accidents in the area, all which will put your management skills to the test.<br><br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673610/extras/passengers_employees.png?t=1725232871"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Passengers</h2>Passengers in Airport CEO all have their unique personalities, needs, a background story and most importantly; a flight to catch (on time). Passengers are thoroughly simulated and their decisions, behaviors and opinions about your airport are affected by several factors. Passengers in Airport CEO, just as in real life, must wait in lines, check in, pass security and then entertain themselves until their flight is ready for boarding. Arriving passengers must find their way the baggage claim, get a hold of their bags and maybe pass a customs booth before getting on their airport transfer. Whether they’ll be able to actually catch their flight is up to you: Passengers might have a hard time finding their way around the airport so you build an information desk, passengers might get irritated because of the long security queue and waiting time so you extend its capacity, passengers might complain about the lack of fun things to do in the gate area so you build a duty-free shop or exclusive brand boutiques.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Employees</h2>Employees are those you rely on to keep your airport running. Just as passengers they are simulated individuals who have a mind of their own. Employees have a number of different roles and it is your job to make sure that your airport has the right and necessary work force at any time. From passenger service agents, janitors, ramp agents and mechanics, security officers to administrators and executives. The more you expand your airport’s capacity and services, the more versatile and skilled your employees have to be. When employees interact with passengers, they’ll have to be skilled at managing people and stress resistant in order to avoid making mistakes or give bad customer service.<br><br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/673610/extras/facilities_ceo.png?t=1725232871"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Facilities and buildings</h2>Airports are complex mega-structures with a lot of different buildings and facilities. While a small airport might not need more than a simple grass runway and a terminal, as you grow your airport you will have to expand its facilities ranging from air control towers, larger aircraft stands and taxiways to fire, weather, catering or fuel stations. As your airport grows your terminal grows with it and you will have to make sure that it is equipped with the necessary facilities that passengers are expecting. Building a terminal in Airport CEO is highly customizable where you lay out its shape and interior such floor type, walls, windows and doors. Baggage needs to be processed and transported to the same flight as its owner and its all up to you to avoid bottlenecks and by designing the ultimate airport terminal.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Being a CEO</h2>Data, data, data! As the acting CEO of your airport you need to be able to make difficult business decisions based on current operation. In Airport CEO you’re provided with multiple sources of information from which you can draw conclusions and manage your airport. As the CEO you will not only be responsible for the architecture of the airport but also for those working in it. Tired of planning every flight? Establish an informatics department and let an automated system do it for you! Tired of assessing the monthly budget balance? Hire a CFO which can help you cut cost and set prices. Best of luck!"

Be wary of those that lack loyalty to the republic – they are prone to a life of crime, and their reduced efficiency can hurt throughput. Oftentimes, they are best left without access to opportunities where they can do more harm than good. Monitor your nation’s overall happiness and loyalty to ensure few are choosing to leave – provide them with better lives, or rely on propaganda to get the most out of your citizens.<br></li><li>Your peoples’ needs can be imported from neighboring countries, or they can be manufactured locally through complex production chains. Massive fields will harvest grains that can be turned into bread and booze at food factories and distilleries. Clothes factories will produce clothes as long as they have fabric, which in turn is produced at fabric factories with the help of crops, chemicals, and water. Manufacture or otherwise acquire all manner of goods, from the aforementioned necessities to the luxuries of radios and TVs, and transport them from factories to warehouses to local stores where your citizens can obtain them to fulfill their needs. <br></li><li>There are many essential services your citizens will want access to as well – electricity, water, and heat are necessary for survival, each with their own supply chains to maintain. Watch for demand to ebb and flow with the seasons, and prepare for harsh winters lest your population suffers a sudden tragic drop. Education is provided through schools and universities, with higher levels of education opening up additional employment opportunities for your people, unlocking access to new technologies and production capabilities in your nation. Entertainment comes from local parks and theaters as well as radio and TV stations, while physical fitness is provided by local pools and sports fields. Ensuring these services are available and within reach through an efficient transit system is essential for a healthy, prosperous populace.</li></ul><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/784150/extras/headline_03.png?t=1744896878"" /><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/784150/extras/image_04_loop.gif?t=1744896878"" /><br>From roads to railways, and from sea to sky, managing the transportation of goods and people is vital to the health of your republic.

Operate interconnected systems to facilitate the movement of people across these massive expanses, even using cable cars and winding dirt roads to provide access to the more remote parts of your republic.<br></li><li>Trucks, trains, cargo planes, and cargo ships are essential for moving resources long distances, with different subcategories of each vehicle determining exactly what type of goods it can move.

I.e. if you capture a strategic point, for everyone in the room it is shown as yours, if you have enough resources to strengthen the defense of that point, it will be much harder for all the other players to capture it, because of the increased number of defense bots, or to increase their combat quality, at your expense. You can also increase the redemption cost of a point by investing game money into its development, and it won't be enough for the other players to capture the point, they will have to possess an amount of money higher than the bar you set. For example there is always the choice to strengthen one position but very well or two positions but at an average level. What is the best course of action is up to you.<br><br>When approaching an objective you will have the choice of passing it in Stealth mode or engaging in an open confrontation in Arcade mode. Stealth mode is favoured in high difficulty areas where reinforced defence forces are more likely to kill you if alerted, but where you can get a lot of bang for your buck if you play stealthily. If you stand on the threshold of a region that you can, feel free to include arcade mode, in which case you will have a place to rebuild near the captured positions, as well as, depending on the training of your character, starting bonuses when revived. Remember, however, that all bonuses have to be paid for in coin.<br><br>Each point has a certain economic value. Owning combinations of control points increases their economic potential many times over. With that in mind, it must be understood that not only skillful weaponry will bring you closer to victory, but also the intelligent allocation of economic resources. You'll need to keep the infrastructure of your facilities in good working order to maximise your profits. Infrastructure can be damaged by time or by a rival saboteur if he enters your territory.<br><br>Of course you do not always have the time to fight back your rivals, but that is no problem. The mobile app will give you time to deal with economic issues, alert you to attempts to reclaim your landlord.<br>attempts to recapture your points, to strengthen your point defenses or to collect profit. Profits not yet collected can be stolen by other players. Once they have infiltrated you, they may not be able to take control of the point, but they can rob you or sabotage it, so it's important to keep your finger on the pulse of the game and a mobile app can be a good helper.<br><br><strong>Submit this world to your laws, win economically and by force, crush the anarchy in the region with a firm fist of your power.</strong>"

This includes the careful design of street layouts, the strategic positioning of buildings and the consideration of their interrelationships. A well-planned city can significantly increase economic efficiency, which in turn can translate into increased city revenues. <br><br>The key is to create a harmonious balance between residential areas, production zones and sacred buildings, buildings that provide entertainment, but also special buildings that provide care for structures and people. In addition, aesthetic improvements such as obelisks, statues and gardens can enhance the quality of life for residents, making the city not only a centre of economic activity but also a desirable place to live.<h2 class=""bb_tag""><strong>Diplomacy and politics:</strong></h2>The Governor will face a series of difficult decisions in a dynamic and evolving political landscape. Meeting the demands of Pharaoh and other cities, responding to military threats and navigating the complexities of a hierarchical society will become routine tasks.

Every time you die, your children will succeed you, and each child is unique. Your daughter might be a Colourblind Archer, and your son could be a Pacifistic Chef. Either way, one of them is getting conscripted.","<img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253920/extras/animated_gameplay_banner_lossless_with_border_resized.gif?t=1710829748"" /><br><br>Rogue Legacy is back! But now it's got a 2 on the end of it!<br><br>Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs.  In this game, your legacy defines you.  Spend your parents’ inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance.  Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities.  Your daughter could be a Ranger.  She could also be vegan.  It’s a new experience every time.  Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to.  Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world.  Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253920/extras/rl2_header.png?t=1710829748"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Every Adventure is Unique</h2>New monsters, new traps, and new layouts await you every time you enter the Kingdom. This is a world where improvisation, and not memorization is the key to success.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Wildly New Classes</h2>No two classes play the same. Hide atop Ivy Canopies as the Ranger, and rain poisoned arrows down onto your foes. Take to the skies as a Dragon Lancer and fly across the skies striking foes at massive speeds. Or sing and dance through your enemies, as the joyous bard, leaving only a trail of bodies behind you. Rogue Legacy 2 supports 15 new classes, with 15 distinct styles of play.  <br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253920/extras/4classes.png?t=1710829748"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Brand New Style</h2>We’re taking a whole new artistic approach to Rogue Legacy 2. The sequel features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops.  The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar RL look and feel.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Revamped Biome Generation</h2>We went all-out with biome generation to make each area in RL2 feel completely new.  Each biome adopts different “build strategies” to create completely unique yet-still-randomly-generated regions.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253920/extras/4biomes.png?t=1710829748"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">True Metroidvania</h2>To really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities that fully reveal the world’s secrets.  These are not basic lock-in-key abilities, but powers that fundamentally change how you play.  And heirlooms are not simply handed to you.  You must prove your worth, provided you can find them.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Traits 2.0</h2>Though fun the first time, the traits in RL1 often wore their welcome later in the game.  We’ve now added gold modifiers to entice players to take on new challenges.  The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward.  This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Relics and Resolve</h2>One of the most exciting new features to Rogue Legacy 2 is the ability to pick up Relics, which are unique items that change how your run is played.  Gain stat modifiers, complete special challenges, and even gain brand new abilities as you traverse the kingdom.  But be careful, the more Relics you obtain the more your resolve is shaken, and all Relics are lost if your hero perishes. <br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253920/extras/relic.png?t=1710829748"" /><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Improved Accessibility</h2>We’ve taken accessibility to the next level with the introduction of House Rules.  Toggle contact damage, tweak global damage and health, and even give yourself flight for difficult platform sections.  You have complete control over how you want to play the game.  We’ve also introduced new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">A Rich Narrative</h2>Not only is the lore to the world of Rogue Legacy greatly expanded in the sequel, but it runs deep. New lore awaits you all the multiple NG’s in. Beating the game once is only the beginning.  Learn about the inevitable collapse of a once thriving kingdom, and discover the dark secrets of the ones responsible.  And connect and build relationships with the characters you meet along the way.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">New Game+ for Days</h2>Your journey has only begun after beating the final boss in RL2.  There is a ton more to explore and discover on multiple playthroughs.  You must choose how the game gets harder, from unique biome hazards, to special boss fights.  The experience keeps changing for near infinite replayability.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">More of Everything</h2>Of course we’re also adding more of everything people loved from the original Rogue Legacy.  More traits, more spells, more classes, more biomes, more enemies, more equipment, more rooms, more story.  <strong>More secrets</strong>... Just more everything.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Clownanthropy.</h2><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1253920/extras/clowns.png?t=1710829748"" /><br>Holy smokes!

Essentially it's our preparation for the sequel to Supraland.<br>While David Münnich made the first Supraland game pretty much alone, he had a smaller role in this one. The core team for this one had 6 people.<br>Pretty much everyone on team built 1 or 2 regions of the game world and in that sense it is very experimental.<br><br>It was supposed to be a little DLC for Supraland , but it got a bit out of hand and got more and more ambitous. Instead of 3 months it took us 27 months to make this (Supraland 1 was in development for 16 months).<br>It can be considered &quot;Supraland 1.5&quot; because there are still a lot things from the first game, but at the same time it's a new world with a bunch of new mechanics.<br><br><br><strong>Combat:</strong><br>If you're a fan of the first Supraland you might be interested in the approach to combat in this new game. After having learned a lot of lessons, the core concept was changed a lot and can still be considered experimental. We will surely learn some more lessons from this one for the next game.<br>The enemies are now much more separated from puzzles and won't get in your way there. The all new enemy types behave much more different from each other and there is no more one-fits-all solution to them. Hope you like it!"

This means that there are spots which are better than others, but they are limited; which towers do you place on these spots? do you save them for a tower you haven't unlocked yet? or do you put everything you have there now? are the good spots even in a good location or are they too far off the path? These are all strategical questions you will have to answer every game.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1843760/extras/StoreCustomTextExpandThePath.png?t=1643386141"" /><br>Every level of the game you must choose a direction to expand the path. The path will randomly twist turn and split often. Wrangle what control you can over it to influence the shape of the level and how far enemies must travel down each path to get to the tower. Do you want enemies from all the paths to come one at a time as to not over saturate your defenses? Or do you want all of the enemies to merge together for your AOE damaging towers?<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1843760/extras/StoreCustomTextUnlockUpgrade.png?t=1643386141"" /><br>During each game you will be able to choose random upgrade and unlock cards. These cards will let you build new towers or upgrade existing towers giving them better damage, range or new abilities.<br><br>After each game you will gain experience which can be used to unlock further towers and upgrades to appear in game. You can also unlock permanent upgrades which will persist through every game you play giving you a small boost to the start of your next game.<br><br>With over 400 unique cards and upgrades there is nearly endless replayability!<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1843760/extras/StoreCustomTextLearn.png?t=1643386141"" /><br>Your tower will be attacked by several different types of monsters. As the game progresses you will encounter more complex and dangerous enemies. They can heal, sprint, launch attacks or even spawn more enemies themselves. Many of the abilities that monsters have will apply to nearby monsters making enemies dangerous in large packs depending on the enemies you are facing; even a weak monster can buff up a stronger one to dangerous levels.<br><br>Each tower deals with certain types of enemies better than others. So every game you may have to consider whether to build up defenses in advance or to wait for the new threats to emerge and adapt on the fly.<br><br><img class=""bb_img"" src=""https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1843760/extras/StoreCustomTextJoinTheDiscord.png?t=1643386141"" /><br>Join the Die of Death community to stay up to date with any new development, give feedback and suggestions or just chill with us in our memery.<br>Discord: <br>Twitter: "
